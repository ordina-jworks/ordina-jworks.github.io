## Style guide

Write a blog post as if you were writing code.
Adopt the [**one sentence per line** method](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandon-rhodes/blog/master/texts/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line.rst).

By starting a new line at the end of each sentence,
and splitting sentences themselves at natural breaks between clauses,
a text file becomes far easier to edit and version control.

This allows commenting on specific sentences in a pull request.
If a change is made to a sentence,
the diff will only show the difference between the old and new sentence,
and not the complete paragraph.
