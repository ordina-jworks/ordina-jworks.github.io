                <p>
                    The current <span class="accentuate">FRONTEND TECHNOLOGIES</span> allow us to create fast, reliable and easy to maintain applications 
                    that are accessible on a wide set of devices ranging from smartphones to tablets to desktop computers. 
                    More importantly, they can be created for multiple platforms using a single code base. 
                    This applies to both web applications and hybrid mobile applications. 
                    A single code base means less recurring errors and is easier to maintain and test. 
                    At Ordina JWorks, we embrace technologies such as <span class="accentuate">ANGULAR</span> and <span class="accentuate">IONIC</span>
                    and apply them in a number of high-profile projects.
