                    Our Application Platforms practice aims to empower multidisciplinary teams with expertise such as cloud-native deployment, cloud platforms and CI/CD pipelines.

                    As a Cloud-native engineer you are multi-tasked, you feel at home in a development or platform team.
                    Within our agile development team you are jointly responsible for building features with business impact.
                    In addition, you will strengthen the team with your expertise in automating the Software Delivery Lifecycle.

                    This translates among others into setting up <span class="accentuate"> CI/CD pipelines</span>, application management via monitoring & logging and configuration of the cloud infrastructure.
                    If you are active in a platform team, you will help outline the cloud infrastructure on Azure, AWS, Google and VMware Tanzu.

                <p>
                    You will support multiple development teams through best practices, guidelines, tooling and support.
                    You will carry out the DevOps values and culture! You build it, you run it!
