                    As a software architect you play a key role in the realization of projects,
                    where <span class="accentuate">architecture</span> is the differentiator. You create high-level project designs that support and steer the client's strategy.
                    You follow the latest trends and developments within your domain and you can make recommendations on how to adopt them.
                    You share your <span class="accentuate">knowledge</span> with colleagues in competence centers on topics s.a. architecture, <span class="accentuate">cloud</span> and security.
                    You do not back down for pre-sales activities and you use your expertise to win an offer.
