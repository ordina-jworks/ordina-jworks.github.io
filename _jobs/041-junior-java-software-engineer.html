                <p>
                    We strive to remain thought leaders in the ever changing technology market.
                    JWorks makes this a personal goal of each of our colleagues to stay on top of the game. 
                    This can be done by following or contributing to numerous <span class="accentuate">WORKSHOPS</span>, coding sessions and webinars we organise, 
                    but what’s more fun than going to <span class="accentuate">INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES</span>
                    such as Spring I/O in <span class="accentuate">BARCELONA</span> or MongoDB World in <span class="accentuate">NEW YORK</span>? 
                    Take a couple of days extra to enjoy the surroundings and get to know your colleagues better!

                <p>
                    We’re growing quickly and oftentimes this can result in limitations and rules prohibiting creativity and freedom. 
                    Not at JWorks though. We’re very fond of our <span class="accentuate">DOWN-TO-EARTH CULTURE</span> and no-nonsense way of working. 
                    Prefer a <span class="accentuate">MACBOOK</span> with <span class="accentuate">INTELLIJ</span> over a Windows with Eclipse? 
                    No problem. Want to make an impact on the architectural choices or tools we use? Jump right in!
