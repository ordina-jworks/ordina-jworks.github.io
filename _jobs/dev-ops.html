                <p>
                    We’re growing quickly and oftentimes this can result in limitations and rules prohibiting creativity and freedom.

                    Prefer a <span class="accentuate">MACBOOK</span> with <span class="accentuate">INTELLIJ</span> over a Windows with Eclipse? 
                    No problem. Want to make an impact on the architectural choices or tools we use? Jump right in!
