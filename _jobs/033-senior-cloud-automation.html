                <p>
                    We’re growing quickly and oftentimes this can result in limitations and rules prohibiting creativity and freedom. 
                    Not at JWorks though. We’re very fond of our <span class="accentuate">DOWN-TO-EARTH CULTURE</span> and no-bullshit way of working. 
                    Prefer a <span class="accentuate">MACBOOK</span> with <span class="accentuate">INTELLIJ</span> over a Windows with Eclipse? 
                    No problem. Want to make an impact on the architectural choices or tools we use? Jump right in!
