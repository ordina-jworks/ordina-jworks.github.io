                    As API architect you are the bridge between business and IT, you know how to support organizations in the development of their API strategy.
                    From your experience you know how to translate business questions into the most optimal IT solution.
                    You do this by mapping the application landscape and reusable services of the customer.
                    You always start from the service economy and <span class="accentuate">API-first</span> thinking.
                    In addition, you have experience with <span class="accentuate">integration projects</span> and you know the different <span class="accentuate">patterns</span> that you can apply to turn an organization into a connected company.
                    You have a vision on how to establish effective API governance within the organization resulting in a clear API approach and reference architecture.
                    As a specialist you are perfectly aware of the importance of well designed APIs.
                    You have enough technical experience and expertise as a technical architect to have teams of developers and analysts implement APIs correctly.
