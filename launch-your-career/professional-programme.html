                        <p>We believe that a developer shouldn't live on an island, only doing development stuff. A developer with operational skills is of more value to an organization, because he or she can bridge the gap between project teams and infrastructure teams. Knowing how to ship your application is an important aspect. This course will take you from feature branching and Git to CI tools and orchestration tools.</p>

                        <p>The "cloud"... another buzzword. But investigating Platform as a Service can be of great value to your organization. Building and maintaining server racks in your basement is not always necessary anymore. You have different levels of abstracting the infrastructure side of things. You'll lears about the basic principles of cloud native applications and PaaS platforms and we'll dig deeper into Pivotal Cloud Foundry and OpenShift.</p>

                        <p>Alright, cool. You've been granted a project by a customer and the development team can start in a couple of weeks! But there are a lot of things to think about when scoring and managing a project: presales activities, scope management, team coaching, architecture, backlog prioritization, etc. This course is about all of those topics and is essential in becoming a good team leader or project manager.</p>
