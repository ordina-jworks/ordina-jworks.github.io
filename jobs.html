        <h2 class="major">JWorks in a nutshell...</h2>

        <p>
            We're growing quickly and oftentimes this can result in limitations and rules prohibiting creativity and freedom.
            Not at JWorks though.
            We're very fond of our <span class="accentuate">down-to-earth culture</span> and no-bullshit way of working.
            Prefer a <span class="accentuate">Macbook</span> with IntelliJ over a Windows with Eclipse?
            No problem.
            Want to make an impact on the architectural choices or tools we use?
