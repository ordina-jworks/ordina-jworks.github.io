<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Devoxx Belgium is a Java community conference in Antwerp, Belgium.
Every year in November it is organised and always has a great assortment of bleeding edge technology talks, methodology talks and architectual insights.</p>

<p>During this edition, about 30 JWorks colleagues joined talks at Devoxx.
Ordina again had a very popular booth by providing attendees nachos, the venue is a cinema after all.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/audrey_neveu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audrey Neveu</a> gave this inspirational keynote.</p>

<p>This talks, following the same format as the similarly titled book, provides a chapter by chapter overview of the struggles and issues with diversity in our industry and what steps our community can take to improve.
The key takeaway is to be at least aware of the issue and to try to be sensitive to undertones in jokes and messages towards all members of our community, especially as they might not seem harmful at first sight.</p>

<p>A typical <a href="https://twitter.com/venkat_s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Venkat Subramaniam</a> talk.
In a funny but straightforward way he explained the pitfalls, do’s and don’ts for architects.
He provided a 12 point guideline that all architects should adhere to.
‘Prototype beats any arguments’ and ‘Every technical decision should have an expiration label’ are just a few examples.</p>

<p><img class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto;" alt="12 point guideline" src="/img/2019-11-18-devoxx-belgium-2019/venkat-12-points.jpg" /></p>

<p>This talk is a definitely must-see as he provides his view on how architects should behave in an organisation with the usual portion of humor.</p>

<h3 id="running-kafka-in-kubernetes-a-practical-guide">Running Kafka in Kubernetes: a practical guide</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/katestanley91" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Kate Stanley" src="/img/2019-11-18-devoxx-belgium-2019/kate_stanley.jpg" /></span></a></p>

<p>This is a talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/katestanley91" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Stanley</a> from IBM.
She works in the IBM Event Streams project.</p>

<p>This talk provides a good overview of common pitfalls with setting up Kafka on a Kubernetes cluster.
Katherine introduces all basic concepts, so following this talk is possible without a ton of Kafka and Kubernetes knowledge.
She discusses how several Kubernetes constructs are used to support and enabled the usage of Kafka and Zookeeper.
Liveness and readiness probes, Stateful sets, Pod anti-affinity, Persistent volumes and headless services are all discussed.
Lastly Katherine discusses the different options for running and managing a Kafka cluster on Kubernetes.
Both the <a href="https://github.com/IBM/charts/tree/master/stable/ibm-eventstreams-dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IBM Events Helm charts</a> and the <a href="https://strimzi.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strimzi operator</a> are shown and discussed.
Strimzi is an operator that allows Kafka cluster to be created and managed through CRDs in Kubernetes.</p>

<p>She also provided us with some tips about what you need to monitor when running your Kafka cluster:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure to verify your brokers on the In Sync Replicas (ISR) <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka/monitoring.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metrics</a>, especially when doing rolling upgrades so you will not lose any data.</li>
  <li>Verify that your Zookeeper instances have reached a quorum.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/saturnism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ray Tsang</a> is a developer advocate for the Google Cloud Platform.
He is a Java Champion and works on improving the usability of GCP for Java use cases.</p>

<p>Ray shows some tools and their use cases when developing Java applications on Kubernetes.
Most tools are shown in a small demo.</p>

<p>Discussed tools</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testcontainers</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack-memory-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Java Memory Calculator</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/springboot-graceful-shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graceful shutdown library</a></li>
</ul>

<p>He also provides some common pitfalls when developing Java for Kubernetes.
He refers to his talk about common <a href="https://saturnism.me/talk/docker-tips-and-tricks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docker pitfalls</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, he showed a demo of how an IntelliJ plugin, when combined with Skaffold, can allow a developer to debug a container running on an actual Kubernetes cluster, straight from their local machine.
Side note, this is super cool!</p>

<h3 id="apache-pulsar-101-architecture-concepts--benchmarks">Apache Pulsar 101: architecture, concepts &amp; benchmarks</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/@waxzce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Quentin Adam" src="/img/2019-11-18-devoxx-belgium-2019/quentin_adam.jpg" /></span></a></p>

<p>A talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/@waxzce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quentin Adam</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/@StevenLeRoux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven Le Roux</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Pulsar</a> is a pub sub messaging system built on top of <a href="https://bookkeeper.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Zookeeper</a>.</p>

<p>Bookkeeper is a distributed writer log on which Twitter Manhattan has been based.
Because Pulsar uses Bookkeeper as the underlying storage engine, its brokers are by design stateless freeing them up from having to deal with storage constraints.</p>

<p>A broker can have different roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/concepts-architecture-overview/#brokers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">broker</a>: this is the default option and can be compared in functionally with a Kafka broker.</li>
  <li><a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/concepts-architecture-overview/#pulsar-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proxy</a>: this deals with external communication between the brokers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently a proxy just handles outside communication with the brokers, but there is a proposal <a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/PIP-46:-Next-gen-Proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIP-46</a> to let it handle much more, including dealing with the Kafka binary protocol and MQTT.</p>

<p>By default, a topic will not be partitioned, but if you want you can create these without any problem as you can see <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/concepts-messaging/#partitioned-topics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
A difference with Kafka is that a partition is subdivided in segments, with the oldest segment containing the oldest entries.</p>

<p>Pulsar feels like a nice mix between streaming and standard message queuing patterns, something worth looking into.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jpkrohling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juraci Paixão Kröhling</a> is a SE at RedHat working on the Kiali team and a maintainer of Jaeger Tracing.</p>

<p>He provides a brief overview of the basic concepts of a services mesh, its inner workings with a sidecar and their advantages and issues.
Next, he discussed how different features of a service mesh can solve common concerns w.r.t. routing, resiliency, security, observability and distributed tracing.</p>

<p>The last part of the talk is an extensive demo of the four tools/technologies discussed in the talk: Jaeger, Istio, Quarkus and Kiala.
A demo service is deployed and a distributed tracing example scenario is shown and discussed.</p>

<h3 id="top-tips-for-terrible-tech-talks">Top Tips for Terrible Tech Talks</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/chethaase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Chet Haase" src="/img/2019-11-18-devoxx-belgium-2019/chethaase.jpg" /></span></a></p>

<p>In this talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/@chethaase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chet Haase</a>, he provides us with the guidelines for what makes a good technical talk for him.</p>

<p>Don’t provide an agenda, your material should speak for itself and have a logical begin, middle and end.</p>

<p>Make sure that you are not reading slides or even speaker notes, as at that moment you will loose the focus of the audience.</p>

<p>A lot of hints also focus on simplification:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a small, catchy title</li>
  <li>no walls of text</li>
  <li>no complicated diagrams</li>
  <li>simplify code, it doesn’t need to compile</li>
</ul>

<p>Have eye contact with the audience, but not with an individual as that might become creepy.
Finally, learn how to project with your voice and movement, bring some power into your talk.</p>

<p>Be in the room before your talk and have a chat with some of the audience, it can be pretty rewarding for the attendees, but most importantly the first words you utter will be the most nervous ones.</p>

<p>Don’t follow a rehearsed script, do not fake emotions which you don’t have.
But by no means skip on practice and preparation, as you need to own the material you are bringing.</p>

<p>And most importantly, be real and have fun.</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-after-your-startup-is-acquired">What happens after your startup is acquired</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/renatatamasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Renata Tamasi" src="/img/2019-11-18-devoxx-belgium-2019/renatatamasi.jpg" /></span></a></p>

<p>This was an amazing talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/renatatamasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renata Tamasi</a>, founder of Samebug and currently working at Rollbar.</p>

<p>During this talk, she took us through the journey of running and later-on selling her start-up to Rollbar.
She starts by showing the struggles they had to get the start-up going in Europe and what the pitfalls they uncovered during journey.
Simply put, getting a SaaS based start-up off the ground and making is successful in Europe is almost impossible without the founders moving to the US.
During their journey, Renata explained the different paths they tried with Samebug ranging from trying to raise funding for their start-up to finally getting acquired by Rollbar.</p>

<p>This is a must see talk for everyone who wants to join a start-up and it will be very familiar for anyone who was in a start-up at one point in time.</p>

<h3 id="resiliency-and-availability-design-patterns-for-the-cloud">Resiliency and Availability Design Patterns for the Cloud</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sebsto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Sebastien Stormacq" src="/img/2019-11-18-devoxx-belgium-2019/sebsto.jpg" /></span></a></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sebsto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sebastien Stormacq</a> is a senior Technical Evangelist as AWS.</p>

<p>Your system should still work when a failure occurs, even if it’s just in a degraded state.
Your business should not rely on a single person being available and present.</p>

<p>Geo redundancy is explained and how you can use availability zones (AZs) to have geo redundancy.
He also explained a scenario where an AZ fails and a hot failover is performed using an Elastic Load Balancer.
Always spread architectures over multiple AZs or use regionless services (S3, ELB) which are multi-az by default.</p>

<p>Load shedding is a technique to drop all traffic once a service becomes loaded beyond a preset point of healthy load.
This prevents the service from being overloaded and crashing.</p>

<p>Shuffle sharding is a technique to reduce the blast radius for an outage by creating isolated compartments in the infrastructure.</p>

<p>Finally Sebastian provides two very good resources:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Well-Architected</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/@adhorn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos engineering blog</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Takeaways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use Availability zones to achieve Geo redundancy</li>
  <li>Use autoscaling mechanisms to have self-healing VMs</li>
  <li>Test your backups</li>
  <li>Use a split database setup. Split logically or functionally (read-write / sharding)</li>
  <li>Set and sync timeouts</li>
  <li>Implement backoffs for retries with jitter</li>
  <li>Make sure database operations are idempotent</li>
  <li>Use circuit breaks to prevent overloading an already degraded system</li>
  <li>Implement health checks</li>
  <li>Reject traffic when load is high on the service (load shedding and throttling)</li>
  <li>Apply shuffle sharding techniques to limit blast radius of outage</li>
  <li>Perform GameDays</li>
  <li>Experiment with Chaos engineering</li>
</ul>

<p>SSL is outdated and should be not be used anymore.
Documentation can be confusing as SSL is sometimes used to discuss SSL and TLS setups.
Only TLS should be used as SSL has been broken (cracked) multiple times.</p>

<p>Maarten goes on to explain the basic concepts of public and private keys.
He also explains all the mathematics behind the RSA key creation.</p>

<p>This talk is ideal for people wanting to get a brief overview of how TLS works.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-the-future-how-80s-arcade-games-taught-me-clojure">Back to the Future: How 80s Arcade Games Taught me Clojure</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ladymeyy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Mey Beisaron" src="/img/2019-11-18-devoxx-belgium-2019/ladymeyy.jpg" /></span></a></p>

<p>In this talk <a href="https://twitter.com/@ladymeyy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mey Beisaron</a> explained how she learned <a href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clojure</a>.</p>

<p>If you often learn a new programming language, it becomes much easier.
For her latest position she needed to start using Clojure.</p>

<p>A very good book to get started with learning Clojure is <a href="braveclojure.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clojure for the brave and true</a>, which is actually a funny book.
After the book the website <a href="http://www.4clojure.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4clojure</a> is a good source of exercises you can follow.</p>

<p>But she still felt that that wasn’t enough to understand the language completely.</p>

<p>Some years ago, for Java, she was able to learn it in one weekend, by writing a simple 2D game.
Writing the game made her feel the need to use objects much more naturally.
Not only that, with the game you also need other concepts likes threads, etc.</p>

<p>When writing a game, do focus on a simple game, so you can truly focus on the language you need to learn.</p>

<p>But Clojure did take more then a weekend, immutability changes everything, it messes with your head.</p>

<p>In order to write a game there are several steps you need to follow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Understand the 2d game structure
It should be pretty simple, identify the framework functions and the game logic.
The framework functions deal with the outside world: network connections, loading resources, player input, …
While the game logic identifies the win conditions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find code of a game written in Clojure.
So you can learn from an existing source.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>An interesting game library to use with Clojure is <a href="https://github.com/oakes/play-clj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oaks/Play.clj</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Map that game
Find the code which moves the character, which loads the assets, …</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add a feature
Start coding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write a new game
Write your own game with the knowledge you have acquired.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dream big, start with tiny steps!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A nice talk brought with great enthusiasm.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/codefinger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Kutner</a> works at Heroku and is a core maintainer of <a href="https://buildpacks.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buildpacks.io</a>.</p>

<p>He starts this talk by providing a set of common pitfalls and best practises for creating Dockerfiles in Rapidfire.
Multi-stage builds, combining multiple run commands into one and using proper base images for all docker builds are just a few examples.</p>

<p>Joe then discusses the pros and cons of <a href="https://github.com/moby/buildkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buildkit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jib</a> as tools for building Docker images.</p>

<p>Lastly, Joe explains what Buildpacks are, their origin, their use cases and what the architecture is.
The different advantages of Buildpacks are extensively explained and the lifecycle of a typical Buildpack is shown.
Pack is discussed as an easy way to use Buildpacks for a Spring Boot application.
Joe demos the usefulness of Buildpacks with the use case of the HeartBlead CVE.</p>

<p>This talk is recommended for an audience that is interested in building Docker images without having to deal with Dockerfiles.</p>

<h3 id="broken-buildtools-and-bad-behaviors-the-maven-story">Broken Buildtools and Bad Behaviors; The Maven Story</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rfscholte" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Robert Scholte" src="/img/2019-11-18-devoxx-belgium-2019/rfscholte.jpg" /></span></a></p>

<p>We tend to keep doing things the same way because they were required in the past.</p>

<p>Eventually something breaks and we go to Stack Overflow or we ask our colleagues and we find a fix or workaround,
but how long are we going to use this workaround?</p>

<p>These workarounds become a pattern and these patterns control people.</p>

<p>“Works on my machine” is mostly caused by local code changes, different OS, JDK, Maven, Files and/or Properties.</p>

<p>Maven manages files for your through the Local Repository. The local repository is a dependency cache without time-to-live and can be located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${user.home}/.m2/repository</code>.</p>

<p>The local repository of Maven is actually broken.
Maven 2 had a dumb cache, once something was downloaded it would stay there forever.
Maven 3 introduced cached artifacts that got verified for existence with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_remote.repositories</code>.
Artifacts that got deleted from Maven Central will be detected and fail your build.
The Maven repository has checksums, but they are not being checked by default.
You can enable this using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-C</code> for strict checksum checking causing a build failure or lax checksum checking using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-c</code> which will only warn for checksum mismatches.</p>

<p>Are you running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mvn clean install</code> by default?
You probably said “yes” like most developers.
This a workaround for Maven 2 which is no longer needed in Maven 3.</p>

<p>Dependency resolution in Maven 2 was broken.
It was unaware of the reactor and dependencies had to exist in the local repository.
Maven 3 is reactor aware meaning install is no longer required.</p>

<p>I/O is slow, so logging, files and downloading the internet with Maven is slow as well.</p>

<p>As logging is slow, you should aim for a clean Maven output.
So use your logging framework and do not use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">System.out</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">System.err</code>.
Disable logging during testing (using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loglevel=off</code>) and in the extreme run Maven with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-q</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">–quiet</code> which will disable all output and just tell you when it’s done.
When you enable debugging on Maven you’ll notice your build time will increase even though nothing has changed.</p>

<p>As files are slow, we should not use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mvn clean</code>.
Most of the Maven plugins are aware if they must execute their task.</p>

<p>The Maven CI extension (stands for Maven <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clean install</code> extension) which will register clean and install when you keep executing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clean install</code>, your build will eventually fail as this is a bad practice.
Properties resolution are mostly defined in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pom.xml</code>, but also in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">settings.xml</code> and system properties.
By adding a parameter to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mvn deploy -Dspring.version</code> you can change your deployed Spring version.
This is however not limited to Spring.
You can also set this for the Java version, but please NEVER EVER do this.</p>

<p>Versions could also break your builds due to conflicts with branch merging.
You should isolate versions and make them unique.
Maven 3.5.0 introduces CI-friendly placeholders which allow you to use placeholders for revision, SHA1 and change list, but multi-modules require a hack to rewrite your pom.
To resolve this issue, there will be something new called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maven.experimental.buildconsumer</code> which will land in Maven 3.7.0 and it will require Java 8 or above.</p>

<p>Treat your pom as production code so remove dead code like unused dependencies, plugins, properties and reports.</p>

<p>Keep improving and locate and optimize time consuming processes, automate as much as possible and keep having fun.</p>

<p>Be like a responsible pilot and try to understand every plugin and think if you still need it.
Stay curious and keep yourself informed.
Watch out for questions with outdated answers (on Stack Overflow) and find information at the source.</p>

<p>Maven is up for grabs.
About <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">60~80%</code> of Java project/developers use Maven.
About <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">95%</code> (sub)projects have just ~5-10 active volunteers, there is no company behind this project.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>One of the takeaways from this conference is that Kubernetes now is the de facto deployment platform for Java applications moving forward.
During the conference a lot of tools, Jib popped up a few times, and integrations with IDEs have been showcased and every talk seems to assume that the deployment platform is Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Event-driven talks are also in a lift.
There were quite a few talks about Kafka or talks about software that can integrate with Kafka.</p>

<p>Finally, the conference was a great success again.
Ordina handed out tons of nachos, every attendee has caught up with the trends in our community and all vendors have been able to showcase their newest products.</p>

<p>See you next year, Devoxx people!</p>
