Although still quite Oracle- and Java-heavy, the rebranding (and collocation with Oracle Open World) means that there were also a lot of talks about other programming languages, developer tools, … 
Our colleague Tom van den Bulck and ex-colleague Tim Ysewyn were invited to give their Workshop on Kafka Streams and enjoy the rest of the conference.

<h2 id="keynotes">Keynotes</h2>

<p>Next to all activity in the conference center, workshops and talks, of course there were (a few) keynotes.
These took place in a separate great hall and we summarized the best ones below.</p>

<h3 id="java-keynote-the-future-of-java-is-now">Java Keynote: The Future of Java Is Now</h3>

<p><span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Jessica Pointing" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1174071948164251648/DLMG7FWe_400x400.jpg" /></span></p>

<p>At the Java keynote which opened the conference on monday a few speakers were invited. These talks mostly dealt with outlooks on the future. Firstly <a href="https://twitter.com/jessicapointing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessica Pointing</a> talked about the current state and prospects of quantum computing.</p>

<p>She gave an explanation of what Quantum Computing actually is, and how modern computers can consist of special components (equivalent to transistors in classical computers) to take advantage of the special properties of so-called qubits. 
A qubit or quantum bit is a unit which can exist in a superposition of states, which means it can be 0 and 1 at the same time, as opposed to a classical bit, which can only be one or the other. 
You can use these properties to devise really specific algorithms like Shor’s or Grover’s algorithm which can solve certain problems like prime factorization much faster than classical algorithms (here’s a really good explanation on how Shor’s algorithm can break encryption on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvTqbM5Dq4Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Youtube</a>).</p>

<p>Keeping the title of the keynote in mind, one of the most important questions is “When will we have Quantum Computers?” and as you’ve already guessed the answer is indeed “Now”.</p>

<p>A fun part of this talk was that there was a live link for the audience to answer a poll to estimate how far along the technology stands in this area. Most of the audience correctly guessed that at present 
we have quantum computers which consist of 10-100 qubits. Current quantum computers do come with the caveat that they can still only keep their state for a short time.
The advances which still need to be made mostly consist of making sure the quantum properties of the qubits can be kept intact for longer before we can really speak of sustainable quantum computers.
Nevertheless Jessica really made the point that the age of quantum computers is in the near future if not now already. She even showed a <a href="https://github.com/johanvos/quantumjava" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a> which enables everybody to experiment and write
algorithms or programs which can theoretically be run on quantum computers (in Java of course).</p>

Next Georges Saab, Vice President of the Java Platform Group at Oracle, officially announced what was already expected, namely that Java 13 was out as of that day:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Java 13 is live: <a href="https://t.co/YqCVg3CTSg">https://t.co/YqCVg3CTSg</a></p>&mdash; Brian Goetz (@BrianGoetz) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianGoetz/status/1174008054813081600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2019</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><br />
After that he invited a lot of people from different backgrounds on stage (or on video) to talk about how they experienced the new, faster release cadence of the Java language, which means there is a new version of
Java out every 6 months. These were people who worked on Java at Oracle, with Java on Open Source projects, were part of the JCP, …</p>

<p>The conclusion of most of these testimonials was that almost everybody was quite suspicious at first about the idea to do a release every 6 months but that all were pleasantly surprised by how well it seemed to work and that they urged everybody to upgrade to the latest versions as soon as possible because there are almost no downsides to it.</p>

<p>Lastly it was <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianGoetz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Goetz’</a> turn to talk about the future of Java, in which he demonstrated some of the new language features which have been included in the releases
since Java 10, as well as previewed some upcoming stuff. He also gave an extended version of this talk <a href="https://t.co/dzzuWze3gX?amp=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later</a>.</p>

<h3 id="code-one-community-keynote-game-on">Code One Community Keynote: Game On</h3>

<p>One of the less serious but certainly entertaining talks was the community keynote, in which a lot (and we do mean A LOT) of well-known people in the Java community (Java Champions, developer advocates, JCP members, …)
came on stage and acted out a history of the Java language as it has been used in the past. The through line was the idea that Java has been used through the years to help develop video games and 
it continues to be relevant today thanks to a host of new projects which are springing up everywhere.</p>

<p>It was a bit of a silly show but it was good fun and at the same time interesting to see how far the Java community has come. At some point, <a href="https://twitter.com/henri_tremblay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henri Tremblay</a> even did some live
coding on a VM running Windows ‘95 while chatting to his past self via a chatbot, which was truly impressive.</p>

<p>There was a lot of buzz on Twitter about the event:</p>

<h2 id="usual-suspects">Usual Suspects</h2>

<p>As always, there are a few speakers at every conference who are household names and who always deliver.
Some of these you can also meet and experience in Belgium at Devoxx or at our very own <a href="https://ordina-jworks.github.io/join/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JOIN</a> conference, like <a href="https://twitter.com/DataDuke" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Nothdurft</a>.
These talks are always very interesting and of a high standard, therefore we will only highlight them briefly.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/venkat_s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Venkat Subramanian</a> gave no less than six talks at the conference, two of which we were able to attend.
These were about <a href="https://youtu.be/pWW8uqAPT-s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Dozen Cool Things You Can Do With JVM Languages</a>
and “Functional Programming Idioms in Java” in which Venkat shows you things which are really useful but look so obvious when he points them out in his incomparable style.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mkheck/status/1174413471674294272" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Heckler</a> talked about <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mkheck/drinking-from-the-stream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Use Messaging Platforms for Scalabiliy and Performance</a> and did an impressive live demo
in which he built an application which produced, transformed and consumed events in three seperate projects in less than 15 minutes, using Spring Cloud Stream.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://twitter.com/starbuxman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Josh Long</a> talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/Y-r_S2UAzGY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Reactive Revolution</a> and “Bootiful Testing” while <a href="https://twitter.com/smaldini" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephane Maldini</a> gave us an overview of the reasons
why you should (or should not) start using reactive programming.</p>

<h2 id="groundbreakers-hub">Groundbreakers Hub</h2>

<p>If you wanted a break from the (literally hundreds of) talks, there was a large area called the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/code-one/hub.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Groundbreakers Hub</a> where a lot of like-minded tech enthusiasts could gather and discuss
the ongoing conference (in some cases accompanied by a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OracleCodeOne/photos/a.10150738878780318/10155758354410318/?type=1&amp;theater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blockchain Beer</a>).</p>

<p>As always, there were booths of all big representatives at which you could gather information about new products, do some demo coding or collect some nice gadgets. There was also a corner
with arcade game consoles to relax, and also a <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/oracle-raspberry-pi-supercomputer,40412.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raspberry Pi supercomputer</a> on display.</p>

<h2 id="kafka-streams-workshop">Kafka Streams Workshop</h2>

<p>The workshop we gave ourselves was once again a success, with about 30 people from around the world attending. An explanation of what the workshop contains has already been given in <a href="/conference/2018/12/17/Devoxx-MA.html#stream-processing-live-traffic-data-with-kafka-streams-by-tom-van-den-bulck-and-tim-ysewyn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a previous blogpost</a>.</p>

<h2 id="using-istio-and-kubernetes-to-build-a-cloud-native-service-mesh">Using Istio and Kubernetes to Build a Cloud Native Service Mesh</h2>

<p>Another workshop which we followed (which was guided by <a href="https://twitter.com/saturnism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ray Tsang</a>) showed us how to easily set up an Istio service mesh on a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud.</p>

<p><a href="https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is Istio?</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Istio is an open platform-independent service mesh that provides traffic management, policy enforcement, and telemetry collection.</p>

  <p>Open: Istio is being developed and maintained as open-source software. We encourage contributions and feedback from the community at-large.</p>

  <p>Platform-independent: Istio is not targeted at any specific deployment environment. During the initial stages of development, Istio will support Kubernetes-based deployments. However, Istio is being built to enable rapid and easy adaptation to other environments.</p>

  <p>Service mesh: Istio is designed to manage communications between microservices and applications. Without requiring changes to the underlying services, Istio provides automated baseline traffic resilience, service metrics collection, distributed tracing, traffic encryption, protocol upgrades, and advanced routing functionality for all service-to-service communication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was surprisingly easy to set up an entire Kubernetes cluster with service mesh in less than an hour, after which there was still time to try out some of the nice features of a service mesh, like setting up
special routing rules to enable Canary deployments or A/B testing scenarios, fault injection / circuit breaking, tracing, … Which can all be handled by Istio itself without making any
changes to your application (except for propagating the headers which are required for tracing). Also a lot of added on applications like Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, … all worked straight out of the box.</p>

<p>For the workshop we received special temporary accounts but if you use your own account (which has a free trial option) you can certainly try and follow the steps in the very extensive <a href="http://bit.ly/istio2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slides</a> and <a href="https://github.com/retroryan/istio-workshop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read-through</a>
to set this up yourselves.</p>

<h2 id="quarkus-trivia-night">Quarkus Trivia Night</h2>

<p>All work and no plays makes us dull boys so there was also time for some relaxation. We were invited for a Trivia Night organised by <a href="https://www.openshift.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenShift</a> and <a href="https://quarkus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quarkus</a> at a brewery close to the conference center, which was a nice change of pace from all serious presentations.</p>

<h2 id="monitor-kafka-like-a-pro">Monitor Kafka Like a Pro</h2>

<p>A subject close to our own workshop was presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/gamussa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viktor Gamov</a>, a developer advocate for Confluent.
He talked about best practices for monitoring your Kafka clusters in a very interesting presentation.
The exact slides were not made available but are very similar to <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ChesterChen/sfbiganalytics20190724-monitor-kafka-like-a-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these</a>.</p>

<p>Some basic monitoring is just to verify that your producers and consumers are able to read and write data from Kafka.
You can set up a specific topic on which you can just send a message and consume it again every 15 seconds, then raise an error after for example four failures et voila, you have basic monitoring.</p>

<p>Measuring latency is already more advanced, but every time you experience performance issues, always check your latency because it might be a waste of time to start looking into Kafka errors or your own service when your network connection is acting up.</p>

<p>In order to check if your brokers are up, just execute a <code class="highlighter-rouge">grep java</code> on the brokers.</p>

<p>Kafka exposes a ton of <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka/monitoring.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JMX metrics</a>, which you can export with Prometheus, the Confluent cloud uses the same mechanism to acquire metrics.</p>

<p>The most important metrics to monitor are to verify the state of your partitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">kafka.controller:type=KafkaController, name=OfflinePartitionsCount</code> Offline partitions is an actionable metric, as this indicates that a partition has no leader and thus is no longer readable or writeable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">kafka.server:type=ReplicaManager, name=UnderReplicatedPartitions</code>: Underreplicated partitions is the most important metric, something is cleary wrong. Whenever there are no longer enough replicas of a partition in sync you can no longer produce messages to that topic.
This corresponds to the configured <code class="highlighter-rouge">min.isr.partitions</code> of a broker.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also important to verify if your brokers have enough resources like: CPU, Bandwidth, Disk, …
Always monitor your disk usage, always.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other metrics which are pretty important:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">kafka.controller:type=KafkaController, name=ActiveControllerCount</code>: this indicates wether an <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Kafka+Controller+Internals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Controller</a> is present.
This is the most important node of your kafka cluster.
1 = OK, 0 is NOT OK, 2 is VERY NOT OK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">kafka.server:type=SessionExpireListener, name=ZooKeeperDisconnectsPerSec</code>: Zookeeper disconnects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">kafka.controller:type=ControllerStats, name=UncleanLeaderElectionsPerSec</code>: the rate at which unclear leader election occurs, though this option is disabled by default.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">kafka.server:type=ReplicaManager, name=IsrShrinksPerSec</code>: When a broker goes down the ISR will shrink, when it comes back it will expand again (<code class="highlighter-rouge">kafka.server:type=ReplicaManager, name=IsrExpandsPerSec</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">kafka.server:type=KafkaRequestHandlerPool, name=RequestHandlerAvgIdlePercent</code> / <code class="highlighter-rouge">kafka.network:type=SocketServer, name=NetworkProcessorAvgIdlePercent</code> as this verifies how often your request and processor threads are idle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For your consumers an important metric is <code class="highlighter-rouge">records-lag-max</code>, because when this is growing it will indicate that your consumers are lagging behind and can not process the same amount of messages as your producers are producing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also important to set a performance baseline for your producers and consumers.
This allows you to verify configuration changes you have made and their impact on your Kafka system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, you should also pay attention to old producer and consumer versions, as these force the broker to convert messages between these versions everytime, which will have an impact on the heap memory usage.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Victor also pointed us to a nice tool to use when you want to profile your java application: <a href="https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">async-profiler</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/oracle-code-one-2019/flame-graph.svg" alt="" width="75%" /></p>

<p>Besides creating cool flame graphs, this tool can inform you about what your java application is doing and where you might have a problem.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-tracing-in-kafka">Distributed Tracing in Kafka</h2>

<p>This was another workshop by <a href="https://twitter.com/gamussa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viktor Gamov</a>, of which the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0JYx7erh_0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3634" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recording</a> and <a href="https://speaking.gamov.io/Y8yrHk/bringing-observability-to-your-stream-processing#sHXi414" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slides</a> are shared.</p>

<p>Over time the complexity of your system and subsystems starts to grow and it becomes too complex to contain all the logic in your head.
In the past, each system would have its own monitoring system, every system was different in the how, what and when something is monitored.
Troubleshooting therefore could take hours, days, weeks, …</p>

<p>Observability is just a fancy word for monitoring because monitoring sounds boring to devs.
Cindy Sridharan wrote a nice <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/distributed-systems-observability/9781492033431/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">book</a> about distributed tracing.
She also writes blogposts like <a href="https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/distributed-tracing-weve-been-doing-it-wrong-39fc92a857df" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distributed tracing - we’ve been doing it wrong</a>.</p>

<p>From her book come the pillars of observability:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A log: A raw, immutable sequence of events of a single instance of a service.</li>
  <li>Metrics: Numerical measures aggregated at a given point of time, sourced by your log events. These tend to be actionable.</li>
  <li>Distributed tracing: Allows us to have a total picture of a request within the application. This answers which services are involved and where there are failures.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kafka tends to become the de facto standard to handle data within organizations, becoming the central nervous system of any company, which makes it more and more important to include Kafka within your tracing.</p>

<p>Some ways how you can implement tracing in kafka are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>OpenTracing Java API for Kafka can be found on <a href="https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-kafka-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-kafka-client</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another approach is to use interceptors like <a href="https://github.com/riferrei/kafka-tracing-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/riferrei/kafka-tracing-support</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Tracing can be visualized with <a href="https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaeger UI</a>.</p>

<h2 id="devops-theory-vs-practice-a-song-of-ice-and-tire-fire">DevOps Theory vs. Practice: A Song of Ice and Tire Fire</h2>

<p>One of the last, slightly more light-hearted talks took place in the last afternoon of the conference. <a href="https://twitter.com/jbaruch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baruch Sadogursky</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gamussa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viktor Gamov</a> opened
their talk with a skit in which Baruch spouted well-known DevOps clichés, like “Everything must be 100% automated”, “We do Continuous Security well” or “Your problems are so unique, no vendor can possibly understand them”
while Viktor translated this into the harsh truth that none of these are absolute or applicable in every situation and you have to adopt your approach accordingly. While entertaining, it also laid bare the truth that none of these
devops principles act as a Silver Bullet.</p>

<p>Next they explained the idea of the Cargo Cult, a term which originated in Oceania when the people there, after the Second World War was over, started building airplanes out of straw.
They believed that this was the cause of the technological advancements and prosperity (cargo) which arrived on these islands at the same time as the actual airplanes, and that when they rebuilt these planes, more cargo would automatically follow.
The analogy with the modern tech landscape, is that some people might believe that by merely adopting the latest techniques and tools (Kubernetes, Docker, DevOps, …), all other problems will automatically solve themselves.
From experience, we all know this isn’t true.</p>

<p>Instead, we should analyse where we are as an organisation and determine which steps to take to progress to where we want to be before just adopting something like Kafka because people at 
conferences give nice demos and workshops and tell you all will be fine. 
Before we take a decision like this, we first need to be aware of the answers to The Four Questions:</p>

<p><img src="/img/oracle-code-one-2019/four-questions.png" alt="" width="75%" /></p>

<p>Answering the last two questions requires an entirely different talk, but the first one we can try and tackle using a maturity model, popularized by <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/MaturityModel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin Fowler</a>.
Maturity models have their own share of problems and critics, but Baruch and Viktor pose that, if done right, they can help your organization or team make signifant 
advancements towards being ready to tackle your business problems in a more efficient way.</p>

<p>Now the question is “How do you write a <em>good</em> maturity model?”. Using an example, simply created in Excel, Viktor and Baruch try to explain that the most important things to
take into account for a maturity model are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It should describe a process, not an end goal.</li>
  <li>It should be tailored specificly to your case, not exactly as prescribed in “the book”.</li>
  <li>It should focus on outcomes, not specific tools to use.</li>
  <li>It should constantly be evaluated and evolve, not written once and then forgotten.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/img/oracle-code-one-2019/dos-donts.png" alt="" width="75%" /></p>

<p>The answer to the question “Is it even a good tech?” can be answered by advisory / research companies like Forrester or Gartner but because these are for-profit
companies their suggestions might be skewed towards the companies which are already established / rich or more in the limelight. A better option might be to look
at the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thoughtworks Tech Radar</a> which is publicly available and provides an assesment of a whole array of modern
technologies and determines if you should Adopt, Assess, Trial or Hold these.</p>

<p>Moreover, you could argue that it’s even better to extend the question to “Is this even a good tech <em>for our team</em>”, in which case it’s a good idea to <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/how-to-byor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build your own tech radar</a>
which at JWorks we <a href="https://ordina-jworks.github.io/tech-radar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also did</a>.</p>

<h2 id="progressive-web-applications-vs-native">Progressive Web Applications VS Native</h2>

<p>One of the few frontend (but still a bit Oracle) related talks was about PWA’s, a topic which we are also starting to explore at JWorks, given by Marta Hawkins.</p>

<p>Ionic gives a good definition of a Progressive Web Application:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web app that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. These apps meet certain requirements (see below), are deployed to servers, accessible through URLs, and indexed by search engines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The premise of the talk was mainly about comparing the capabilities of a PWA compared to a classic native application, and in most cases refuting the arguments which could be brought against PWA’s.
The first such argument is that you cannot access all native phone functionality, but recently the support for almost all of these functions, like taking pictures, watching videos, 
using location information, using gestures, … have been made available for PWA’s.</p>

<p>All major browsers are now also supporting almost all PWA functionality. The next obvious argument is that if you choose to write a native application you have to maintain multiple code bases,
whereas you only need to write one application and distribute it independently of app stores in the other case. This also means you can release new functionality
without having to go through the process of getting it approved on the respective app stores, and your application will be more easily discoverable on your 
search engine of choice. All of these arguments result in the fact that PWA’s are better to drive user engagement.</p>

<p>Next Marta talked about the preconditions you need to have your web application recognized as ‘progressive’, of which there are only three:</p>

<p><img src="/img/oracle-code-one-2019/pwa-conditions.png" alt="" width="75%" /></p>

<p>A service worker is what provides the PWA with its special capabilities.
This is what enables offline functionality, installability, notifications, request caching, … Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-service-worker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer guide</a> describes it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A service worker is a type of web worker. It’s essentially a JavaScript file that runs separately from the main browser thread, intercepting network requests, caching or retrieving resources from the cache, and delivering push messages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course not everything is sunshine and rainbows, so next Marta also warned for some pitfalls they already encountered in the past:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Browser support is good, but not complete. Chrome is the frontrunner and Safari is notably lagging behind.</li>
  <li>The same is true for the different OS’s. Android treats PWA’s as first class citizens, on iOS you need to really go and find the ability to install the app to your home screen.</li>
  <li>Developing and debugging the applications is also not trivial. Chrome is developing and delivering better debugging tools.</li>
  <li>Caching is never trivial, but especially in service workers it sometimes seems to behave in mysterious ways.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://static.rainfocus.com/oracle/oow19/sess/1552707018783001LVCE/PF/PWA_final_1568924085498001Vope.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slides</a> of this talk are also available.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, we had a great time in San Francisco (and also at the conference).
It was noticeable that Oracle products were given preferential treatment, and the fact that it is so big means that sometimes it was not easy to keep track of which talks were interesting to follow.
On the other hand, almost all the talks we followed were of a high standard and we learned a lot.
And the Groundbreakers Hub was an awesome place to connect with other developers.</p>

<p>10/10 would go again.</p>
