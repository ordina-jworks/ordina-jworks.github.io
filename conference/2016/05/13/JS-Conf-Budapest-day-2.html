<p>This year’s edition of JS Conf Budapest was hosted at <a href="http://akvariumklub.hu/">Akvárium Klub</a>.
Located right in the center of the city, below an actual pool, filled with water!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Akvárium Klub is more than a simple bar: it is a culture center with a wide musical repertoire from mainstream to underground.
There is always a good concert and a smashing exhibition, performance, or other event happening here, in a friendly scene, situated right in the city center.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>JS Conf Budapest is hosted by the one and only <a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake">Jake Archibald</a> from Google.
Day 2 started at 9 o’clock.
Enough time to drink great coffee and enjoy the breakfast.</p>

<blockquote class="clear"><p>
The physical world is just another binary machine.
Data creation, analysis, and corruption combined with JavaScript can make new and unexpected things.
Can you programmatically extract joy from the subjectivity it exists in?
Can it be translated into intentional forms to hook others in?
This session will gently take you along on a personal journey of how you can use code to expose new expressions of the mundane secrets we hold dear.

<p>Suz talked about programming and art.
She spent a lot of time on the subway and was wondering if it would be possible to use the sounds of the subway to create art.
So she started by taking <a href="http://noopkat.github.io/formulartic-spectrum/#slide-41">the sound of the subway doors closing</a> and analysing that part.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sampling the audio to pixels resulted in 300k pixels</li>
  <li>Make it smaller by converting to 16-beat song</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://noopkat.github.io/iltsw/index2.html">Check out the visualisation!</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>The top section: Stand clear of the closing doors, please.</li>
  <li>The mid section: white noise</li>
  <li>The bottom section: ding dong!</li>
</ul>

<p>Suz created a visualisation of the sampled audio that resulted in cats sitting on an subway.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cats can sit on 16 seats in subway car, each seat representing a beat</li>
  <li>In total there were 308.728 samples which divided by 16 beats result in 19.295 samples per beat. Suz took the average of the sample values of each ‘beat’</li>
  <li>The seats have different colors that represent the drum beat and oscillator note</li>
  <li>When a cat is sitting on a chair, we get a guitar strum and note</li>
</ul>

<p>The subway example is made using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SVG images</li>
  <li>divs</li>
  <li>CSS animations</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://noopkat.github.io/iltsw/index5.html">Check out the working example!</a></p>

<h4 id="but-im-better-at-hardware">But I’m better at hardware</h4>

<p>So Suz created a <a href="https://noopkat.github.io/formulartic-spectrum/#slide-64">subway card with built in speaker</a>!</p>

<h3 id="recap">Recap</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Creative coding gets you out of your comfort zone and teaches you to use tools you use everyday in another context</li>
  <li>Art doesn’t care about your semicolons
    <ul>
      <li>Code can be messy</li>
      <li>No one cares about semicolons, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Art doesn’t care about perfection
    <ul>
      <li>Again, your code doesn’t really matter</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Art is about what you learned</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Write messy code</li>
  <li>Make lots of mistakes</li>
  <li>You deserve a break from being judged</li>
  <li>Code like no one’s watching</li>
  <li>Don’t ‘git rebase -i’
    <ul>
      <li>Show the history behind good code</li>
      <li>Code evolves from a first idea to a final solution.</li>
      <li>At first, code might not be perfect</li>
      <li>Don’t rebase to hide this fact</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Oliver is a software engineer working on the team behind theguardian.com.
Being passionate about the open web, he aims to work on software that exploits the decentralised nature of the web to solve non-trivial, critical problems.
With a strong background in arts as well as engineering, he approaches web development in its entirety: UX, performance, and functional programming are some of the things he enjoys most.</p>

<blockquote class="clear"><p>
You’re on a train to work and you open up the Guardian app on your phone.
A tunnel surrounds you, but the app still works in very much the same way as it usually would, despite your lack of internet connection, you still get the full experience, only the content shown will be stale.
If you tried the same for the Guardian website, however, it wouldn’t load at all.
Native apps have long had the tools to deal with these situations, in order to deliver rich user experiences whatever the user’s situation may be.
With service workers, the web is catching up.
This talk will explain how Oliver used service workers to build an offline page for theguardian.com.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Oliver talked about the functionality they created with service workers on The Guardian.
When offline on The Guardian, you’ll get a crossword puzzle (always the most recent) that you can play.
We summarized the key parts of the talk for you.</p>

<h4 id="website-vs-native">Website vs native</h4>

<p><strong>Native</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Content is cached</li>
  <li>Experience:
    <ul>
      <li>offline: stale content remains</li>
      <li>server down: stale content remains</li>
      <li>poor connection: stale while revalidate</li>
      <li>good connection: stale while revalidate</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Website</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Experience
    <ul>
      <li>offline: nothing</li>
      <li>server down: nothing</li>
      <li>poor connection: white screen of death</li>
      <li>good connection: new content</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-it-works">How it works</h4>

<p><strong>Service workers</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Prototype built in &lt; 1 day</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is a service worker?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A script that runs in the background</li>
  <li>Useful for features that don’t need user interaction, e.g.:
    <ul>
      <li>Listen to push events, useful for pushing notifications</li>
      <li>Intercept and handle network requests</li>
      <li>Future
        <ul>
          <li>Background sync</li>
          <li>Alarms (e.g. reminders)</li>
          <li>Geofencing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A progressive enhancement</li>
  <li>Trusted origins only (HTTPS only or localhost)</li>
  <li>Chrome, Opera and Firefox stable</li>
</ul>

<p>For now The Guardian is not yet fully on HTTPS, but they are switching at this time of writing.</p>

<p>Some pages have service workers already enabled such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info">theguardian.com/info</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science">theguardian.com/science</a></li>

</ul>

<h4 id="how-did-they-do-it">How did they do it?</h4>

<p><strong>1. Create and register the service worker</strong></p>

This talk covers the past, present and future of web application performance when it comes to delivery optimization.
I'll start by glancing over what you're already doing -- minifying your static assets, bundling them together, and using progressive enhancement techniques.
Then I'll move on to what you should be doing -- optimizing TCP network delivery, inlining critical CSS, deferring font loading and CSS so that you don't block the rendering path, and of course deferring JavaScript.
Afterwards we'll look at the future, and what HTTP 2.0 has in store for us, going full circle and letting us forego hacks of the past like bundling and minification.

<blockquote class="clear"><p>
This talk will specifically focus on the other less common client-side vulnerabilities that are not as frequently discussed.
Intentionally vulnerable applications developed with client-side JavaScript frameworks will be attacked and exploited live.
Remediation strategies will also be discussed so that developers have tools to prevent these vulnerabilities.
Through strengthening the security posture of JavaScript applications, we can take strides towards creating a more secure Internet.

<h4 id="break-the-web-together">Break the web together!</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>They say the best offense is good defense.
No. The best offense is offense.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="hands-on-vulnerability-exploitation-of-medcellar">Hands-on vulnerability exploitation of medcellar</h4>

<p>Anand’s talk started by explaining the most common web application vulnerabilities that currently exist.
We’re talking about SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
During the talk, Anand used an open source application that contains all of these vulnerabilities and which is available for you as a developer to fool around with.
The application is called ‘MedCellar’ and you can find it on <a href="https://github.com/relotnek/medcellar">github</a>.</p>

<h4 id="xss--csrf">XSS &amp; CSRF</h4>

<p>We saw how to perform XSS attacks and CSRF attacks on the MedCellar Application.
These attacks weren’t extremely harmful at first but showed just how they could be exploited.</p>

<p>Using the Burp Suite’s proxy, we were able to inspect all requests/responses the application was performing to get more insights in how the app actually worked.</p>

<p><a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/">Burp Suite</a> is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications.</p>

<p><strong>XSS</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>attacks users</li>
  <li>JS Injection</li>
  <li>Exploits can be bad, really bad</li>
</ul>

<p>XSS is a serious vulnerability. It may not seem so for some people or clients but it really is!</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do we exploit apps where users have direct control</li>
  <li>How do we attack web apps on a private network</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>CSRF Attacks!!</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“Session Riding”</li>
  <li>Attacker sends malicious URL to submit a form to a third party domain</li>
  <li>Victim is tricked into interacting with the malicious link and performs undesirable actions</li>
</ul>

<p>Using a third party domain you can create a form (you won 1 million dollars) to perform an action like this.</p>

<p><strong>BeEF</strong></p>

<p>During the talk, Anand demonstrated how to perform XSS and CSRF attacks.
However, it seemed like you were only able to hack yourself.</p>

<p>Things got serious though, when Anand demonstrated how you could exploit these vulnerabilities way more by using a special Linux distro called Kali Linux and BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kali.org/">Kali Linux</a> is a linux distro designed specifically for Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking.</p>

<p><a href="http://beefproject.com/">BeEF</a> is a Penetration Testing tool that focusses on the browser and possible vulnerabilities in it and the applications running in it.</p>

<p>Combining these two, Anand was able to do basically anything in the users browser and he demonstrated this by running some random audio in the users browser.
Playing audio isn’t that harmful, but you could have installed a keyLogger instead and start tracking anything the user types on his computer.
That seems to be a little bit worse than playing some audio!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you enter a coffee shop and see someone using this, disconnect from the internet and run away as fast as you possibly can.” - Quote from Anand</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="mitigate-against-these-attacks">Mitigate against these attacks</h4>

<p>Implementation of a CSRF mitigation is Tough!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Method Interchange</li>
  <li>Beware of CSRF Token replay</li>
  <li>Token must be tied to the user’s session on the server</li>
  <li>CSRF Token exposed as GET Param: Could potentially have logs or some other network traffic see the CSRF token and intercept it that way.</li>
</ul>

<p>But, luckily for us, CSRF middleware which implements these mitigations has already been developed for us! You can find these libraries on github:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/koajs/csrf">koajs</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/hapijs/crumb">crumb</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/expressjs/csurf">csurf</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="key-takeaways">Key takeaways</h4>

<ul>
  <li>App Sec vulnerabilities can be used in combination</li>
  <li>No state changing operations should be GET requests</li>
  <li>Make sure the CSRF token is cryptographically secure
    <ul>
      <li>Random !== Cryptographically secure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CSRF Middleware Saves Lives!!</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh… And</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cross Origin Resource sharing (CORS)
    <ul>
      <li>Access-control-Allow-Origin: * IS BAD!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Neurons receive electrical signals through their dendrites, and transmit those to the neuron body, called the Soma.
From the neuron body, new electrical signals travel to other neurons.
Sending electrical current from one neuron to another is being done through its axons.
So the axons actually send electrical signals to other neurons and those other neurons receive these signals trough their dendrites.</p>

<p>A better, more thorough explanation of neurons is being described on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron">Wikipedia</a>, but we needed a super simplified explanation of neurons and their main components to further explain what Rob showed us.</p>

<h4 id="science-in-the-browser">Science in the browser</h4>

<p>Neurons and their main components can be ‘encoded’ in special files .swc files.
These files contain multiple records with an ID, X, Y, Z, Radius and Parent-link.
Using all the records and their properties allows you to visually represent the neurons.</p>

<p>There’s already an online repository containing these encoded neurons which you can find <a href="http://www.neuromorpho.org/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now, what does all of this have to do with the browser or JS or anything you would expect at JSConf?
Well, while he was working on his Ph.D. thesis, he started playing around with JS and its related technologies.
And he continued to do so since then, all in function of the neuroscience domain.</p>

<p>As we saw earlier, there’s already a webpage where you can upload swc files with neuron data to visually represent these, but these are rather static images.
Instead, Rob decided to create a platform which can also simulate the behaviour of such a neuron when you trigger it with electrical current on its dendrites.</p>

<h4 id="technology-stack">Technology stack</h4>

<p>Rob used a combination of tools and technologies to build the platform.
Together with his colleagues at IBM research Australia, they built an entire Cloud platform that could perform these complex simulations.</p>

<p>On their IBM Bluemix cloud they run Docker Containers running the algorithm that performs the neuron simulations.
The algorithm is written in C and is based on mathematic formula which is shown in the below image.</p>

<p><strong>Hodgkin-Huxley Model of the Squid Giant Axon</strong></p>

<p><img class="image fit" alt="Hodgkin-Huxley Model of the Squid Giant Axon" src="/img/js-conf-budapest/Hodgkin-Huxley_equation.png" /></p>

<p>The web application used to render the neurons used a combination of tools, most importantly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Webgl: Web Graphics API. Javascript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics.</li>
  <li>three.js: A Javascript 3D library that uses WebGL.</li>
  <li>D3.js: Javascript library for visualizing data using HTML, SVG and CSS</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-tool-in-action">The tool in action</h4>

<p>In the below video you can see what the tool looks and animations look like:</p>

<div class="responsive-embed-youtube">
	<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z_7c6JjicGE?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p>The tool enables researchers to replay a scenario where a certain spike is triggered in a branch of the neuron.
This gives scientists a lot of knowledge and insights about how neurons behave.</p>

<p>Rob gave a really entertaining talk with some really cool visuals of neurons in action.
He introduced us to just the right amount of neuroscience to be able to follow what he was actually doing and showing!</p>

<p>Stefan is a web developer/web lover based in Linz, Austria.

<blockquote class="clear"><p>
In this session, we will explore the major features of the new HTTP version and its implications for todays JavaScript developers.
We will critically analyze recommendations for deployment strategies and find out which impact they have on our current applications, as well as on the applications to come.
</p></blockquote>

<h4 id="unbundle-all-the-things">Unbundle all the things?</h4>

<p>Everybody is saying to not bundle things, minify things, concatenate things, … when moving to HTTP/2.</p>

<p>Tools like Browserify, Webpack, etc. would all become obsolete.
But why? We need to question this and see if this is actually the truth.</p>

<h4 id="the-best-request-is-a-request-not-being-made">The best request is a request not being made</h4>

<p>In HTTP version 1.1 we need to do as few requests possible. Pages like Giphy have 40 TCP connection at a single time!</p>

<p>HTTP/2 was made to prevent the bad parts of HTTP/1.1</p>

<p>HTTP/2 allows a connection to stay open and transfer multiple things over the same connection.
No need for handshakes for each file that needs to be transferred from the server to the client.</p>

<h4 id="rule-of-thumb">Rule of thumb</h4>

<p>A slow website on HTTP/1.1 will still be a slow website on HTTP/2.
You need to perform optimisations no matter what.</p>

<p>Most important part: <strong>do not block the render path</strong>.</p>

<p>Only serve what you really need.
Again, <strong>the best request is a request not being made</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="so-unbundle-all-the-things">So, unbundle all the things?</h4>

<p>So in some way, yes unbundle all the things.
Because you don’t want to transfer bytes you don’t need, but there is something more to it.
This article about packaging will get you on the way: <a href="http://engineering.khanacademy.org/posts/js-packaging-http2.htm">engineering.khanacademy.org/posts/js-packaging-http2.htm</a>.</p>

<p>Create a lot of modules to update as flexible as possible and as small as possible.
When using ES6 we can also use Treeshaking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create independent, exchangeable components</li>
  <li>Create small, detachable bundles</li>
  <li>Think about long-lasting applications and frequently of change</li>
</ul>

<p>Use tools, not rules!</p>

<blockquote class="clear"><p>
What even makes sense in Javascript?

For a language originally created in 10 days it surely has a lot of quirks and perks many JS developers are unaware of.
Sometimes, it might even seem like we fell down the rabbit hole only to find that NaN is actually a Number, undefined can be defined, +!![] equals 1, Array.sort() may not work as you suspected and so much other nonsense that can trip any JS developer’s mind.

This talk is a collection of Javascript’s oddities and unexpected behaviors that hopefully will prevent some future headaches and help understand the language that we all love in a more deeper and meaningful way.

<h4 id="code-debugging">Code debugging</h4>

<p>Debugging can be hard and it becomes harder when working with complex software.</p>

<p>Spaghetti code is difficult to read and maintain.
It can be code that is not organised, has lots of dependencies and is difficult to debug.</p>

<h4 id="the-tech-industry-is-bugged">The Tech Industry is bugged</h4>

<p>A lot of people already contributed to the tech industry.
It has grown very fast and has many flaws.</p>

<p>That’s why we need to have a look at it and try to fix the defects.</p>

<h4 id="understanding-ourselves">Understanding ourselves</h4>

<p>To be able to fix this we need to understand ourselves. Our flaws, limitations, …</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are privileged and need to understand that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Privilege: The human version of “works on my machine”.</strong></p>

<p>Privilege is sitting in your comfy home and not knowing a big thunderstorm is coming that could harm people.</p>

<p>Privilege is being able to stand up when attending a standup and not having to sit because you are disabled.</p>

<h4 id="we-are-biased">We are biased</h4>

<p>We need to understand we are biased.
More often we are being objective and often that is not OK.</p>

<p>We all have biases and we need to realise and understand.</p>

<h4 id="empathy">Empathy</h4>

<p>We need to understand that we need to be empathetic.
Empathy is the right direction.</p>

<h4 id="creativity">Creativity</h4>

<p>Creativity is necessary to design and build good software.</p>

<h4 id="diversity">Diversity</h4>

<p>And so is diversity and understanding each other.</p>

<h4 id="inclusion">Inclusion</h4>

<p>Inclusion means all people in the group are respected for who they are.
The lack of inclusion and diversity is a real problem in our industry.</p>

<h4 id="the-tech-industry">The Tech Industry</h4>

<p>Let’s look at some key points within our industry.</p>

<p><strong>Company</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Lack of diversity</li>
  <li>Lack of inclusion</li>
  <li>Harassment</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Society</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Racism</li>
  <li>Patriarchy</li>
  <li>Capitalism</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tech industry</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Lack of diversity</li>
  <li>Lack of inclusion</li>
  <li>Harassment</li>
  <li>Racism</li>
  <li>Patriarchy</li>
  <li>Capitalism</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="software-can-help-people">Software can help people</h4>

<p>Our software can help people. A screenreader, accessibility, …</p>

<h4 id="but-can-also-ruin-lives">But can also ruin lives</h4>

<p>Our software is racist.
Our software (tools like Siri or Cortana or Snapchat) does not correctly recognise skin color, alters skin color and does not recognise harassment or racism.
Animations in software can trigger panic attacks or epileptic attacks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have a collective responsibility and need to take that very seriously.
Technology and our code is not neutral. Our work is political and has consequences on lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="debugging-the-system">Debugging the system</h4>

<p>Change starts with you, starts with all of us.
What can we do to debug the system?</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Educate yourself</strong>, about systemic issues and oppression</li>
  <li><strong>Practice empathy</strong>, because we need it to be good designers and developers</li>
  <li><strong>Work on Humility</strong>, because none of us are Unicorns</li>
  <li><strong>Understanding Privileges</strong>, and use them for good</li>
  <li><strong>Address biases</strong>, and establish policies to address them</li>
  <li><strong>Listen</strong>, and actively look for voices outside of your networks</li>
  <li><strong>Amplify others’ voices</strong>, and speak less</li>
  <li><strong>Work on diversity</strong>, because it’s our moral obligation</li>
  <li><strong>Work on inclusion</strong>, to make spaces welcoming and safe</li>
  <li><strong>Give</strong>, our knowledge, time, technical skills, money</li>
  <li><strong>Work on being allies</strong>, constantly</li>
</ol>

<p>Quite a talk on some serious matter to close the second day of JS Conf Budapest.</p>

<p>Have you experienced these things yourself in the tech industry?</p>

<p>Have you contributed to debugging the tech industry?</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="day-2-conclusion">Day 2: Conclusion</h2>

<p>Just like day 1, day 2 was one hell of a nice day packed full of great speakers and a superb atmosphere!</p>

<p>The talks by <a href="#rob-kerr-science-in-the-browser-orchestrating-and-visualising-neural-simulations">Rob Kerr</a> and the one of <a href="#lena-reinhard-works-on-my-machine-or-the-problem-is-between-keyboard-and-chair">Lena Reinhart</a> surely got the most attention.
Rob’s talk because it was impressive to see what they achieved over a course of 2 years to visualise neurons in the browser.
Lena’s talk because we got slammed in the face about how faulty the tech industry is at the moment.</p>

<p>This year’s edition was, just like the one we attended last year a very good one!
It is nice to see such a diverse community that cares about technology and people.
This is something we should be very proud of.</p>

<p>A big thank you to the organisers and volunteers to make JS Conf Budapest what it is!</p>
