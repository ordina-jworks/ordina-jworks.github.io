<p>When you’re building software with people from around the world, it’s important to validate that commits and tags are coming from an identified source. By using a distributed revision control system like Git, anyone can have an offline copy of your project’s code repository. In theory having a central repository is not necessary, but it can be used to provide an “official” source from which other developers can clone from and work on. These other floating repositories may contain malicious code because, unfortunately, it is remarkably easy to fake your identity when committing code using Git.</p>

<p>The following command allows any individual with bad intentions to commit (malicious) code under your name, meaning that you will get the blame for the backdoor or exploit “you” committed:</p>

<h2 id="ensuring-trust">Ensuring Trust</h2>

<p>This blog post tells the story of Sherlock H. Sherlock is a witty developer who holds any security-related topic very close to his heart. After a fair amount of pondering about how he could solve the problem of black-hearted developers impersonating his personality, he decided to add <strong>a Digital Signature</strong> to his commits. By adding a signature Sherlock can finally sleep soundly at night because the signature indicates that he really issued the commit and that it has not been tampered with since he sent it. Moreover it can be used to trace the origin of malicious code that has made its way into a repository. The signature also assures non-repudiation, meaning that it becomes difficult for the signer to deny having signed something because the Digital Signature is unique to both the commit and the signer, and binds them together. Sherlock can now wholeheartedly vouch for the commit.</p>

<p>Consider the following scenario:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sherlock wants to send an urgent message to his fellow developer John W. telling that their application has been compromised by Jim M, a criminal mastermind who only has unkind intentions. John wants the guarantee that the message he received is sent by Sherlock and has not been tampered with by Jim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to securely exchange messages, both Sherlock and John will make use of their <strong>Key Pairs</strong>. A Key Pair consists of a <strong>Public and Private Key</strong> which are two unique mathematically related cryptographic keys. As its name suggests, the Public Key is made available to everyone by handing out copies or sharing them through a publicly accessible repository. The Private Key however must be kept confidential to its respective owner.</p>

<p>Sherlock and John can do the following with the use of their Key Pair:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Signing</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The message is still readable to everyone.</li>
      <li>Guarantee of the sender’s identity (aka Sherlock).</li>
      <li>Guarantee that the message has not been tampered with since it has been signed by the sender (aka Sherlock).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Encryption</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The message is only readable by the designated recipient (aka John).</li>
      <li>No guarantee of the sender’s identity (aka Sherlock).</li>
      <li>Encryption can be done <strong>symmetrically</strong> by using a Shared Secret Key, a single key is then used for both encryption and decryption. <strong>Asymmetrical</strong> encryption (aka Public Key encryption) with a Public/Private Keypair uses one key for encryption and another for decryption. Note that the advantages and challenges of using either encryption type is beyond the scope of this blog post.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="enforcing-trust">Enforcing Trust</h2>

<p>Sherlock will combine a digital signature with encryption to convince John that his message is trustworthy.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Sherlock wants to send the following message to John: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Data! Data! Data! I can’t make bricks without clay.</code>. He calculates the <strong>Hash</strong> of this message by applying a publicly known hashing algorithm to the message. The calculated hash by using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d6ba26816599a75310c4c263126d4b44979c7026f90e1db8e9b317d6658f3811</code>. The hash value is unique to the hashed data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sherlock encrypts the Hash with his Private Key. This encrypted Hash together with a certificate containing additional information about the sender forms the Digital Signature. The reason why the Hash is encrypted and not the entire message, is that a hash function can convert an arbitrary input into a fixed length value which is usually much shorter than the original message. This saves time since hashing is much faster than signing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sherlock sends the original message and its Digital Signature to John.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>John receives the message and Digital Signature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever is encrypted with a Public Key can only be decrypted by using its corresponding Private Key and vice versa. Therefore John uses Sherlock’s Public Key to decrypt the Signature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>John also re-calculates the Hash of the original message by applying the same hashing algorithm as Sherlock.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>John compares the Hash he calculated himself and the decrypted Hash received with Sherlock’s message.
If they’re identical he knows the message has not been tampered with during transit.
Should the message been compromised by Jim, then John would have calculated a different Hash than the encrypted Hash that Sherlock has sent along with his message.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="creating-an-identity">Creating An Identity</h2>

<p>In order to sign his commits, Sherlock decided to use <strong>Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG)</strong> as his weapon of choice. GPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard. It allows to encrypt and sign data and communication, features a versatile key management system as well as access modules for all kinds of public key directories.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Download and install GPG from the <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/download/">official website</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open a command prompt</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">      <span class="c"># Generate a new Key Pair.
</span>
      <span class="nv">$ </span>gpg <span class="nt">--gen-key</span>
      </code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sherlock accepted the default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RSA and RSA</code> key. RSA is a widely-used asymmetric encryption algorithm and is named after Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adleman who invented it in 1977. Should you be interested in more mathematical details how this algorithm works, I can highly recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXB-V_Keiu8">“Public Key Cryptography: RSA Encryption Algorithm”</a> on YouTube.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the desired key size. I recommend the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maximum key size of 4096 bits</code> because they provide far better long-term security. While the default of 2048 bits is secure now, it won’t be in the future. 1024 bit keys are already considered within the range of being breakable and while technology advances 2048 bit keys will also become breakable. Eventually 4096 bit keys will be broken too, but that will be so far in the future that better encryption algorithms will also likely have been developed by then.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sherlock accepted the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">default expiration</code> for his key.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He entered his <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">real name and email address</code>. Sherlock provided the verified email address for his GitHub account. This will make it very easy to link his account with his Public Key.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secure passphrase</code>. Choose wisely and be sure to remember it because else the key cannot be used and any data encrypted using that key will be lost.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Congratulations, a newly fresh Key Pair should be generated now.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Like many other developers, Sherlock is very active on GitHub and would like to link his Public Key with his account. He therefore will need to create a textual version of his Public Key. After having executed the command below, the content of the generated ‘pubkey.txt’ needs to be added to his account as described in the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account/">GitHub Help pages</a>. More details about distributing and registering your Public Key to a key server can be found in the chapter ‘<a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#AEN464">Distributing keys</a>’ of the GPG Users Guide. For other usages like encryption and decryption, please refer to <a href="http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto.html">GPG’s Mini HowTo</a>.</li>

<h2 id="signing-your-work">Signing Your Work</h2>
<p>Once Sherlock generated his Key Pair, he can configure Git to use it for signing commits and tags. Following tools can be used to store a GPG key passphrase in a keychain so he doesn’t have to provide it every time he signs a commit: <a href="https://gpgtools.org/">GPG Suite</a> (Mac) or <a href="https://www.gpg4win.org/">Gpg4win</a> (Windows).</p>

<p>Earlier this year GitHub <a href="https://github.com/blog/2144-gpg-signature-verification">announced</a> that they now will show when commits and tags are signed and verified using any of the contributor’s GPG keys upload to GitHub. Keep your eyes open for commits and tags labeled with those green <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verified</code> badges.</p>
