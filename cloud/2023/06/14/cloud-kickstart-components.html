<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Introducing Cloud Kickstart Components: Simplifying Application Deployment on AWS (Internship Project)</p>

<p>We are excited to introduce Cloud Kickstart Components, an internship project aimed at simplifying the process of deploying applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS). As interns, we have developed a template that enables the automatic deployment of applications to AWS, harnessing the power of multiple AWS services effortlessly.</p>

<p>Our internship project focuses on automating the deployment process, eliminating the need for manual configurations and reducing the chances of errors. With this template, developers can seamlessly deploy their applications to AWS, allowing them to concentrate on their core application logic and development tasks.</p>

<p>Through Cloud Kickstart Components, we provide an easy-to-use template that integrates with various AWS services, including EKS and ECR instances, Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon S3 for storage and Amazon IAM. This integration empowers developers to take advantage of multiple AWS services without individual setup and configuration complexities.</p>

<h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>

<p>The first step in our deployment process is for the developer to push their code to the designated repository, such as GitHub. This ensures that the latest changes and updates are available for deployment. Once the code is pushed, our deployment pipeline kicks into action. The Spring Boot application is built, packaged, and transformed into a Docker image. This image encapsulates the application and its dependencies, making it portable and ready for deployment. The Docker image is then stored in a Docker registry, such as Docker Hub. This step ensures the image is prepared and available for deployment across different environments.</p>

<p>We use the power of GitHub Actions, a workflow automation tool, to streamline the deployment process. Using predefined workflows, we configure GitHub Actions to automatically trigger the deployment process whenever a new Docker image is available. GitHub Actions pulls the Docker image from the registry, fetching the latest version of the Spring Boot application built in the previous steps. This ensures that the deployment uses the most up-to-date version of the application.</p>

<p>With the Docker image available, we utilize AWS services to deploy the application. Depending on the specific requirements, it can automatically provision resources such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) instances, Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets and many more. After deployment, we implement continuous monitoring and testing mechanisms using CloudWatch. We set up custom metrics, create dashboards for visualization, and define alarms to detect anomalies or performance issues. Additionally, we leverage CloudWatch Logs to collect application logs for troubleshooting and analysis.</p>

<p><img alt="architecture" src="/img/2023-06-14-cloud-kickstart-components/img.png" style="margin:0px auto; max-width: 750px;" /></p>

<h1 id="docker">Docker</h1>

<p>Docker Hub is a central repository allowing us to store, manage, and distribute our Docker images. At the same time, AWS provides the ideal platform for deploying and running our containerized applications.
To begin the deployment process, we build and package our application code into a Docker image, encapsulating all the necessary dependencies and configurations. 
This Docker image acts as a self-contained unit, ensuring consistent deployment across various environments. We leverage the power of Docker Hub, a trusted and widely used container registry, to store and manage our Docker images. 
By utilizing Docker Hub, we can easily version our images, making tracking and managing changes over time simple.
This ensures that our Docker images are always up to date, incorporating the latest changes and enhancements. Once our Docker images are prepared on Docker Hub, we will deploy them to AWS.</p>

<p><img alt="architecture" src="/img/2023-06-14-cloud-kickstart-components/img_1.png" style="margin:0px auto; max-width: 750px;" /></p>

<h1 id="github-actions">GitHub Actions</h1>

<p>We use the capabilities of GitHub Actions, a workflow automation tool. We have automated various tasks with GitHub Actions, including deploying to Docker and seamlessly integrating our applications with multiple Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>

<p><img alt="architecture" src="/img/2023-06-14-cloud-kickstart-components/img_2.png" style="margin:0px auto; max-width: 750px;" /></p>

<p>One of the key benefits of GitHub Actions is its ability to automate the deployment of applications using Docker images. Using a simple configuration, we have set up workflows that automatically build our applications, package them into Docker images, and push those images to a Docker registry. 
This automation saves us valuable time and effort, ensuring our applications are always up-to-date and readily available for deployment.</p>

<p>This automation allows us to seamlessly deploy our applications, configure the necessary settings, and utilize the full capabilities of AWS without manual intervention. For example, when triggering a deployment workflow, GitHub Actions pulls the Docker image from the registry, distributes it to ECR and deploys it to an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster. Simultaneously, it can create S3 buckets for storage, create/add some CloudWatch metrics, and set up the alarms and necessary permissions and configurations, all in an automated and reliable manner.
This level of automation significantly reduces the complexity and time required to deploy and integrate our applications with AWS services.</p>

<p>In conclusion, GitHub Actions has become an invaluable tool, empowering us to automate the deployment to Docker and seamlessly utilize multiple AWS services.</p>

<h1 id="amazon-web-services-aws">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h1>

<p>We have chosen Amazon Web Services (AWS) as our preferred cloud computing platform. With AWS, we have access to a comprehensive suite of cloud services that enable us to build, deploy, and manage our applications and infrastructure with flexibility, scalability, and reliability.</p>

<p><img alt="architecture" src="/img/2023-06-14-cloud-kickstart-components/img_3.png" style="margin:0px auto; max-width: 750px;" /></p>

<h1 id="amazon-eks">Amazon EKS</h1>

<p>To deploy these containers effectively, we have adopted Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) from Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
AWS EKS provides a robust and reliable platform to deploy, scale, and easily manage our containerized applications.
AWS EKS is a fully managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the deployment and management of containerized applications. 
This allows us to streamline our development and operations processes, enabling faster time-to-market and improved agility.</p>

<p>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) pod is the smallest and most basic unit of deployment within a Kubernetes cluster.
A pod represents a single or multiple instance(s) of a running application workload within the cluster. 
It encapsulates one or more tightly coupled containers that share the same network namespace, IP address, and storage volumes.
These containers within a pod often work together to fulfill a specific task or service.</p>

<p><img alt="architecture" src="/img/2023-06-14-cloud-kickstart-components/img_5.png" style="margin:0px auto; max-width: 750px;" /></p>
