  &lt;p&gt;This year, Pieter Van Hees and Kristof Eekhaut attended the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dddeurope.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Domain-Driven Design Europe&lt;/a&gt;  conference in Amsterdam.
The conference was all about Domain-Driven Design and related topics, with loads of interesting talks from beginners and experts in their field.
In this post you can read about some of the talks and workshops we attended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;p-image&quot; alt=&quot;Carola Lilienthal&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019-02-16-ddd-europe/carola-lilienthal.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Carola discusses nine traps that developers fall into, and which prevent us to focus on the important aspect of developing software, the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trap-1-model-monopoly&quot;&gt;Trap 1: Model monopoly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In order for developers to learn about the domain, they have to talk to the users, in a language that the users understand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to understand is that developers need to talk to the users, because if they don’t they will lose a lot of information. 
However, in a lot of companies, it is the analyst alone who talks to users when he/she gathers requirements.
By having one or more analysts who communicate with users, they have the monopoly of the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When developers do communicate with users, they should do so in a language and/or model that the users understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing class diagrams or database models with users is counterproductive.
The users will not understand this complex model and think it took a lot of effort to create.
As a consequence they either cannot give relevant feedback because they don’t understand it, or they won’t dare to because they don’t want to discourage you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better way to communicate the model between users and developers is to use e.g. a schema with icons and descriptive names for actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019-02-16-ddd-europe/model-with-icons.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;model with icons&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trap-2-only-look-at-the-future-without-taking-into-account-the-present&quot;&gt;Trap 2: Only look at the future without taking into account the present&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at how they are working today instead of only looking what you want to achieve in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself: “Who is doing what wherewith and what for?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid using requirements documents without concrete examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trap-3-forget-about-reuse-in-your-domain&quot;&gt;Trap 3: Forget about reuse in your domain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First think about something being usable, and then see if it can be reused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle should not be applied rigorously and blindly. 
If you apply DRY too often and too soon it often leads to leaky abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trap-4-dont-try-to-be-too-generic-ddd-is-about-being-as-concrete-as-possible&quot;&gt;Trap 4: Don’t try to be too generic, DDD is about being as concrete as possible&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By being concrete in your domain and your code you will have explicit and understandable code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trap-5-if-your-components-are-too-dependent-on-each-other-you-cannot-scale-them-independently&quot;&gt;Trap 5: if your components are too dependent on each other, you cannot scale them independently&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High coupling between components prevents you from splitting them into different services that could scale separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another disadvantage of high coupling is that it becomes difficult to let you software evolve, because changes in one component force changes in others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trap-6-large-business-classes&quot;&gt;Trap 6: Large business classes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example when modeling containers that move through different stages in a harbour.
The large business class could be the container that manages all stages the container goes through.
It would be better to model these stage as separate components.
This is called functional decomposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Don’t create big business classes that serve everybody.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trap-7-how-do-we-know-what-to-build&quot;&gt;Trap 7: How do we know what to build&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we split a big elephant into pieces?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we have four different types of elephants in our business domain.
A common mistake would be to split elephant by different parts of the body. 
Where one component would be all four types of feet, another would be all four types of heads, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might not necessarily be the best approach to split the four elephant types.
The better approach would be to build one small elephant that is fully functioning, and then let it grow each iteration.
This approach lets you learn from each iteration and allows for incremental growth and refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trap-8-the-expert-trap&quot;&gt;Trap 8: The expert trap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people who developed the elephant will start to think they are experts, and know everything there is to know about the elephant, because they built it from scratch.
This assumption is false, because even the developers who built the elephant from scratch have assumptions, and assumptions can be false.
The real experts are, and will remain, the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trap-9-everything-is-new-and-therefore-better&quot;&gt;Trap 9: Everything is new, and therefore better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People tend to believe that this new system they are building will be way better than the old system they’re replacing, because it looks better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they forget is that the users know the old system very well and are often very productive in it.
When the users will start to use the new system, they will feel like beginners again.
They will be less productive than with the old application, at least for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-your-tests-tell-the-story-of-your-domain-by-anne-landro-and-mads-opheim&quot;&gt;Make your tests tell the story of your domain by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/annelandro&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Anne Landro&lt;/a&gt; and Mads Opheim&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;p-image&quot; alt=&quot;Anne Landro&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019-02-16-ddd-europe/anne-landro.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Anne and Mads tell us how they drastically reformed the testing approach for the Norwegian Court Case Management system from constant repetitive manual verification to automated testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They explain that Value Chain tests have helped their team document the domain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PersonIsRegisteredAsDeadAfterStartOfACaseOfDeath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;createACaseOfDeath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;registerTheDiseased&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;registerTheHeirs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;notifyTheNationalRegistrtyOfTheDeath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;assertThatThePersionIsRegisteredAsDead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these tests runs through a workflow of the domain and verifies the state at the end of it. 
They are high level tests that can be understood by all stakeholders, so that anyone - including domain experts and users - can look at a test and verify whether the result is what they expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a  quick glance at this code you can learn a lot about how the domain works. 
Their team also uses this technique to document special cases that they discover in the domain, so that bugs caused by these quirks don’t happen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;domain-modelling-towards-first-principles-by-cyrille-martraire&quot;&gt;Domain modelling towards First Principles by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cyriux&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cyrille Martraire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;p-image&quot; alt=&quot;Cyrille Martraire&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019-02-16-ddd-europe/cyrille-martraire.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
In this great talk Cyrille explains us why he thinks that the Domain-Driven mind set of most teams is &lt;em&gt;“too gentile”&lt;/em&gt; and we aim to &lt;em&gt;“raise the waterline”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With DDD we learned to immerse ourselves in the domain, use our domain-driven skills to understand the domain and conceptualise the domain into conceptual models. 
But we should go further by defining theories for our models and spot the First Principles that the theory consists of. 
Then we can challenge them, so that we can suggest changes to the business instead of reproducing the domain as it is. 
This way we get more involved and get to the next step, which is:  &lt;strong&gt;Innovation!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He points out a number of common problems that many teams have and suggest how we can improve them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-human-compiler-effect&quot;&gt;The Human Compiler effect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we often see is that we are given requirements piece by piece: the first sprint we get one case, then the next sprint another case and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
But most of the time it turns out that all of these cases are actually special cases of some general case that we haven’t been told about.
The reason for this is what Cyrill calls the Human Compiler effect:  someone behaving like a compiler, by taking the general problem and splitting it up and dumbing it down in separate simple solutions for every single consequence, so that a developer can implement them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;tech-depth&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019-02-16-ddd-europe/business_rules_for_dummies.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; style=&quot;margin:0px auto; max-width: 750px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is obviously a bad approach, because by dumbing down the domain for the developers, we keep them “dumb” and unaware of how the domain actually works. This leads to a dumb - and often wrong - implementation of the domain.
We should instead first describe the problem to the entire team. Then the team should build a theory upon it and challenge it by asking critical questions (Why? Why? Why? …).&lt;br /&gt;
This leads to a better understanding of the domain and thus to building better solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-complexity&quot;&gt;Technical complexity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, sometimes we are given an explanation about a problem and some developers turn it in something even more laborious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;tech-depth&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019-02-16-ddd-europe/tech-depth.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; style=&quot;margin:0px auto; max-width: 750px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This increases technical depth and make the code unmaintainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution for this: refactoring and using Test-Driven Development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;theory-vs-residual-mess&quot;&gt;Theory vs Residual Mess&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we start creating theories about the regular world of our domain, often someone from the teams asks: “But what about ALL the other business rules?”. 
We have an obsession for the “big bag of business rules”. As if every business is a bunch of data with a bunch of if-statements on top.
We should realize that there is always some order in this mess and that a lot of things are more regular that irregular. 
We have to find out these regularities, find out the theories behind them and then we can create our domain model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course any business also has irregularities that do not fit into our theories and we can not just ignore these. We call this the &lt;em&gt;Residual Mess&lt;/em&gt;.
However we should not allow this mess to affect our beautiful theories. Instead we should - as Eric Evans explained before - define a &lt;em&gt;Spill Zone&lt;/em&gt; in the application where we can put all the messy parts of the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyrill advices us to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Raise the waterline&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expect untold regularities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Practice TDD&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Practice DDD&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build theories, not just lists of business rules&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn to think based on First Principles. Disrupt and become innovative!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

We are divided in groups of five with one team leader.
The goal: to model an application for the maintenance team of a car rental company in Amsterdam.
The application must determine when a car is due and available for maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New requirements are provided step by step on “requirement” cards, so that we have to adapt and reshape our model each time we discover a bit more about the domain. 
We learn the importance of visualising the solution (model) and talking about the problem based on what we have visualized in front of us. 
Putting notes on the board with the different concepts that we identify, sparks interesting discussions that make use think further about the problem:  Is the given name correct and clear?  Do we mean the same thing when we talk about …?  Do two words on the board actually mean the same thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After each requirement card follows a card for the team leader to consider making changes to the way we work.
One card tells the leader to look for someone who has been a bit quiet or outside of the discussion and move the group around so that he is next to the board.
This immediately make this person more involved in the discussion and we also start paying attention to his view.&lt;br /&gt;
Another card suggests to let someone go through the entire process that is modelled on the board and explain it step by step.
We immediately find out that some definitions on the board are hard to explain and not as clear as we thought they were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this excellent workshop Marijn shows us how easy it can be to come up with a great domain model that is understood and agreed upon by everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lost-in-transaction-strategies-to-manage-consistency-across-boundaries-by-bernd-ruecker&quot;&gt;Lost in transaction? Strategies to manage consistency across boundaries by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/berndruecker&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bernd Ruecker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;p-image&quot; alt=&quot;Bernd Ruecker&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019-02-16-ddd-europe/bernd-ruecker.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
In this talk Bernd explains the challenges we face when using transactions in big applications and distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He starts by reminding us that our Aggregates in DDD are usually our transactional/consistency boundaries. 
Meaning that within an Aggregate, you have an ACID transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were to have a transaction over multiple Aggregates, you would have a stronger coupling between them.
For example you can’t split them easily into multiple separate microservices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you could do is use two-phase commits to have you transaction over multiple Aggregates in separate services.
But the problem is that two-phase commits don’t scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Grown ups don’t use distributed transactions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative solution is the alternative to ACID: BASE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Basically&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Available&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soft-state&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eventual consistency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By applying Eventual Consistency you update one aggregate in one transaction and the other in a different transaction.
This means that the system will be in an inconsistent state for a short time, but eventually it will be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, Bernd explains different strategies how to implement this eventual consistency with an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that we have an credit card payment aggregate that charges a credit card aggregate, and that this communication happens through an asynchronous message. 
This communication can go wrong in multiple ways: the message might never arrive at the credit card service, it might arrive but the payment service doesn’t receive the feedback, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy-1-cleanup&quot;&gt;Strategy 1: Cleanup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the payment service can’t send the message, or if it doesn’t receive feedback that the message was received, it can send a payment failed event.
The problem with this strategy is that this ‘payment failed’ event also might not arrive at the credit card service. 
Which means that it won’t be able to do his cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy-2-keep-state&quot;&gt;Strategy 2: Keep state&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stateful-retry&quot;&gt;Stateful retry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using a stateful retry the payment service would keep the state of whether or not the message was delivered to the credit card service.
As long as the credit card service does not acknowledge that it processed the message, the payment service will keep sending the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stateful-retry-and-cleanup&quot;&gt;Stateful retry and cleanup&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this strategy the payment service keeps retrying to send the message until a timeout has passed or after X retries.
After that it will send a payment failed event for which the retry policy might also apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy-3-compensationsagas&quot;&gt;Strategy 3: Compensation/Sagas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;choreography&quot;&gt;Choreography&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compensation means that if something in the asynchronous process fails, a compensating process will be triggered.
A classic example is a system where you book a hotel in one service which will trigger a car booking.
If the car booking fails, it will emit an event that will be picked up by the hotel service which will cancel the hotel room related to the car booking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system of services responding on events from each other is called orchestration. 
We don’t define in one place how the whole process works, but services know themselves on what to react on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this compensation saga implemented with choreography might become complex because it could be a trainwreck of cascading cancellations.
E.g. a hotel booking triggers a car booking, which triggers a flight booking.
If you have complex processes with a lot of services involved, this might become chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019-02-16-ddd-europe/event-driven-choreography.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;event driven choreography&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;orchestration&quot;&gt;Orchestration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using an orchestration approach there would be one service responsible for managing the whole process.
In the hotel/car/flight example a trip service could be this orchestrating service that calls the other services and tells them to book or cancel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bernd then argues that if you choose an orchestration strategy that BPMN tools and libraries can help a lot in defining these processes.
You could for example define your business process and all compensating activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some libraries even provide quite nice DSLs where you can make your business process quite explicit.
And the good thing is that this business process or saga is even part of your domain logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019-02-16-ddd-europe/orchestration.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;orchestration&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;estimates-or-no-estimates-lets-explore-the-possibilities-by-woody-zuill&quot;&gt;Estimates or No Estimates, Let’s explore the possibilities by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Woody Zuill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;p-image&quot; alt=&quot;Woody Zuill&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019-02-16-ddd-europe/woody-zuill.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Woody starts by pointing out that his workshop does not give answers, but does ask critical questions.
His goal is to share some experiences he had, and he realizes that what works in some companies, does not work in others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this disclaimer he talks about a big project he worked on where they experienced sprint after sprint that their estimates were always plain wrong.
Every retrospective this frustration was mentioned and every time the solution management came up with was that they just had to get better at making estimations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Trying the same thing over and over again expecting different results is the definition of insanity” - Einstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, Woody said, a constant in his 35 year career was that estimations were always off, and people were always trying to solve this by “getting better at estimates”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrong estimates are often not the problem itself, but a symptom of something else.
It could be that they are off because the requirements were unclear, or that requirements keep changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;noestimates&quot;&gt;#NoEstimates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#NoEstimates was originally used to refer to reference a blog post Woody had written on a project where they did not use or make estimates.
But actually ‘No estimates’ is a placeholder for a larger conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woody mentions that for some things in life we want estimates, but we never do because we know it’s impossible.
E.g. how long will this clinical trial take?
How long till we find a cure for cancer?
How long till you finish this work of art?
In fact if we have enough data to definitively say how long something will take to develop, we already built it and we don’t need to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next he asked the audience to explain in a single word what an estimate means. 
Quite some different answers were given, but in general it came down to this list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Guess&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expectation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Misunderstanding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Approximation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these answers the following working definition could be extracted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An estimate is a guess of the amount of work time to create a project, a feature or some bit of work in developing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-do-we-estimate&quot;&gt;Why do we estimate?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some reasons why we make estimates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planning / budget&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Which approach do we choose / in what order do we do things&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dependencies on other teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software development, estimates are often used to attempt to predict the future.
When will it be done?
How much will it cost?
What can we get done this sprint?
What can we get done for this amount of money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically we use estimates to help us make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we have to choose between making project A or project B, we would make an estimation of how long it would take to do either of them.
But do we really want to choose between project A or B based on a guess?
Wouldn’t it be better to do an MVP of both and see which is working best?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is on time or on budget a good measure of the results of our decision?
No, because you cut features, make it unmaintainable, etc.
Isn’t it better to measure customer satisfaction as a metric for success?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this workshop the audience was left with even more questions.
But what we did realize is that often people make estimations without any good reason. 
And sometimes it would be better to reflect on why we do estimations, and see if it really provides us value, and if there is no alternative solution for the problem we’re actually trying to solve with estimations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summing-it-all-up&quot;&gt;Summing it all up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain-Driven Design Europe was a great conference where we got to learn more about software design and techniques that help us do what we love to do the most: creating great software for users.
The organizers did an excellent job in creating a conference with great speakers.
Next year’s conference will take place in Amsterdam on the 6th and 7th of February 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;first_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Pieter&quot;, &quot;last_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Van Hees&quot;, &quot;github&quot;=&gt;&quot;pvanhees&quot;, &quot;linkedin&quot;=&gt;&quot;pieter-van-hees-73671133&quot;, &quot;permalink&quot;=&gt;&quot;/author/pieter-van-hees/&quot;, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;&quot;pieter-van-hees.jpg&quot;, &quot;title&quot;=&gt;&quot;Software Engineer&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;pieter.vanhees@ordina.be&quot;, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Pieter Van Hees is a Java Software Engineer at Ordina Belgium.

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1-vue-with-typescript-an-introduction&quot;&gt;1. Vue with TypeScript, an introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the release of the Vue CLI 3 in August 2018, Vue now officially supports development in TypeScript.
In September 2018, Evan You even announced that &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point/plans-for-the-next-iteration-of-vue-js-777ffea6fabf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the next version of Vue will be rewritten in TypeScript&lt;/a&gt;.
This does not mean that you are forced to use TypeScript, it will still be an option.
TypeScript has numerous advantages such as static typing and transpiling of the latest ECMAScript features for full compatibility with older browsers.
Especially the static typing is a very interesting feature for projects in a professional environment as it helps define more strict interfaces.
With the use of types, you inherently provide documentation to other developers on how to use your code as it offers guidance on how to use your functions, components and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we will make a really simple blog system to showcase how you create a project, create a component, install a plugin and do calls via HTTP.
Our little project will be called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wordvue&lt;/code&gt;.
At the same time we will explain some tips and tricks and give some background information about Vue with TypeScript so that you fully understand what the purpose is of each line of code.
The project can be found in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ordina-jworks/vue-typescript-wordvue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; so you can see a working version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/vue-plus-typescript-small.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2-creating-a-vue-project-with-typescript&quot;&gt;2. Creating a Vue project with TypeScript&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-the-vue-cli&quot;&gt;Using the Vue CLI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the Vue CLI, it is the easiest way to create a new Vue project.
First make sure you have the latest version of the CLI installed with NPM:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npm i -g @vue/cli
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we create our project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ vue create wordvue
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CLI knows some presets but we will go through the manual mode to be sure we select the TypeScript version.
At the time of writing the current default language for Vue is JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/vue-cli-1-manually-select.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit-contain&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;babel--typescript&quot;&gt;Babel + TypeScript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/vue-cli-2-selected-features.png&quot; class=&quot;image right fit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We check the TypeScript option and for the purpose of this article we will not look in detail at the other features of this screen and fall back on the default values.
I also checked CSS Pre-processors just because I like SCSS.
Make sure you have Babel selected, Babel will automatically add multiple polyfills.
The polyfills will help with having backwards compatibility of ECMAScript features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-the-class-style-component-syntax&quot;&gt;Using the class-style component syntax&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/vue-cli-3-class-style-component-syntax.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next screen we will get the question if we want class-style component syntax, for which we answer &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/code&gt;.
With this, we actually install the decorators that can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Vue Class Component package&lt;/a&gt;.
We will now explain the difference between using the class-style component syntax and using the classic Vue syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-classic-vue-syntax&quot;&gt;The classic Vue Syntax&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not use the class-style component syntax, your components will look exactly as if you have rendered them with Vue with JavaScript, but with the addition of types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;VNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'vue'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;HelloComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Hello'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;' world'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;computed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;greeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;VNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'div'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;greeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, you’ll still have the data function, the methods, computed properties and the render function that you can use in regular Vue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;class-style-component-syntax&quot;&gt;Class-style component syntax&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the class-style component syntax, we would write the same component like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'vue'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'vue-class-component'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;HelloComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Hello'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;' world'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;greeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you compare it to the previous version, the data property message is now a regular property in our component class. Methods are present as class methods. And the computed properties can be defined as a getter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-other-settings&quot;&gt;The other settings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you’ve replied &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/code&gt; to the “Use class-style component syntax?” question, you can continue with the default options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the CSS pre-processor, you either choose between Stylus, Less and SCSS. We choose the default &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sass/SCSS (with node-sass)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/vue-cli-4-css-preprocessor.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the linter, you can either choose between TSLint or ESLint with a bunch of configurations.
I opt for the default &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TSLint&lt;/code&gt; option as the support for TypeScript in ESLint is (at the time of writing) fairly recent.
But ESLint is certainly a valid option as the TypeScript has announced in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29288&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;January to June 2019 roadmap&lt;/a&gt; that ESLint will be their own focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/vue-cli-5-linter.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can choose for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Lint on save&lt;/code&gt;option as we want to see immediately the effects of our linter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/vue-cli-6-lint-on-save.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we have to choose if we want the configurations in dedicated files or all bundled together in our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;.
We opt for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In dedicated config files&lt;/code&gt; as we prefer to not clutter the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; with a lot of configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/vue-cli-7-dedicated-config.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vue CLI will now create the project with a Git repository, perform an NPM install and generate a README.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/vue-cli-8-project-generated.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;launching-your-first-vue-project&quot;&gt;Launching your first Vue project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Vue CLI has created your Vue project, you can go with the terminal to the root folder of the project and launch it with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npm run serve
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/vue-default-page.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will see, the CLI starts the development server, starts the type checking and linting service.
By default the project runs on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/code&gt; but if there’s already something running on port 8080, it will pick port 8081 or the next one available.
This way you don’t need to specify a free port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A default Vue project looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/vue-cli-serve.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;3-a-look-into-the-files-created-by-the-vue-cli&quot;&gt;3. A look into the files created by the Vue CLI&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/vue-cli-generated-files.png&quot; class=&quot;image right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The files that the Vue CLI generated are mainly all the configuration files that we wanted separately.
So we have a configuration file for Babel with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;babel.config.js&lt;/code&gt;, PostCSS (which contains the configuration for SCSS) with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;postcss.config.js&lt;/code&gt;, TypeScript with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; and TSLint with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tslint.json&lt;/code&gt;.
You will also find a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; folder for all your NPM packages with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; in which we define all the NPM packages that we need in our project.
If we would have opted for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In package.json&lt;/code&gt; option, we would have had a large &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main folders in which you will work are &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;. We will look at these more in detail later so you fully understand what their purpose is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;public&quot;&gt;Public&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public is meant for static assets like images, favicons and more.
It also contains your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; which is very basic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;en&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;utf-8&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;http-equiv=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;IE=edge&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;viewport&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;icon&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&amp;lt;%= BASE_URL %&amp;gt;favicon.ico&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;wordvue&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;noscript&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;We're sorry but wordvue doesn't work properly without JavaScript enabled. Please enable it to continue.&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/noscript&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- built files will be auto injected --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is only in rare cases that you should adapt the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;.
One example situation would be to add Google Analytics, add more &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;meta&lt;/code&gt; tags or adapt the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; tag.
Vue will automatically inject the necessary generated JavaScript files right before the closing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; tag.
This will include the transpiled version of your own code as well as vendor code.
The most important thing is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; tag with id &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app&lt;/code&gt;.
This should always be present in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; as this is the tag on which Vue will bootstrap the entire application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;src&quot;&gt;Src&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maints&quot;&gt;main.ts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'vue'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./App.vue'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;productionTip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$mount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'#app'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; folder, you will find a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main.ts&lt;/code&gt; file.
This is the one that Vue will execute first.
As you can see this creates a new instance of Vue in which we only define a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; function.
Vue will pass along &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; which is of type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CreateElement&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx/issues/6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;chosen by the creator of Vue&lt;/a&gt; as it is short for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hyperscript&lt;/code&gt;, a term that is used in several virtual DOM implementations.
A hyperscript is a script that will generate HTML structures.
It takes one parameter: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;App&lt;/code&gt;.
Thus in a Vue project, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; will generate the HTML for our App component.
App is our main component that was generated by the Vue CLI and we will dive into that after this section.
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main.ts&lt;/code&gt; should only be adapted to plug in new core functionalities of your application.
For example, a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main.ts&lt;/code&gt; of one of my own projects is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CreateElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;VNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'vue'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./App.vue'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i18n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./i18n'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./registerServiceWorker'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./router'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;store&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./store'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;productionTip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// custom router configuration&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// custom store implementation&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i18n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// my translations&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CreateElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;VNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$mount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'#app'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I have added three core functionalities: a router, a store and an i18n library.
In each component that you make, these functionalities will be available.
The reason why these will be available is because the Vue type gets extended by each of these libraries.
For example in the typings of VueI18n (the i18n library that I use), we find:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;declare&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'vue/types/vue'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$i18n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;VueI18n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;IVueI18n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;$t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;VueI18n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;$tc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;VueI18n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;tc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;$te&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;VueI18n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;te&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;$d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;VueI18n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;$n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;VueI18n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that we will have a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$i18n&lt;/code&gt; property available and five different functions.
If you would use a different i18n library, you will have most of these things also readily available.
For example vue-i18next defines &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$i18n&lt;/code&gt; as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;declare&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;vue/types/vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$i18n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;VueI18Next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;$t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TranslationFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vue itself does not provide an i18n implementation nor a store nor a router nor does it even support HTTP calls by default.
Vue is designed to be as light as possible so that developers can keep a project as lightweight as possible.
Vue does officially support specific NPM packages for these core functionalities.
Other packages will follow the same naming conventions as the official supported libraries for convenience sake.
Like said before we will only focus on the basic Vue functionalities and HTTP calls.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appvue&quot;&gt;App.vue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;App.vue&lt;/code&gt; file is our first component that Vue bootstraps through our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main.ts&lt;/code&gt; file.
It is considered to be the root component.
The Vue CLI generates the App component with one child component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-vue highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Vue logo&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;./assets/logo.png&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;HelloWorld&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;msg=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Welcome to Your Vue.js + TypeScript App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'vue-property-decorator'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;HelloWorld&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./components/HelloWorld.vue'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;HelloWorld&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'Avenir'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Helvetica&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Arial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;-webkit-font-smoothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;antialiased&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;-moz-osx-font-smoothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grayscale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#2c3e50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin-top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;60px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each page and part of a page that you will create, is a component that is a child of the root component.
Together, your whole application should have a component structure which should look like a tree:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;App
	- HomePage
		- HelloWorld
	- NewsPage
		- NewsArticle
			- Reaction
	- ContactPage
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each node of the tree is a component.
With the use of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@Component(...)&lt;/code&gt; decorator, we define which components can be child components of the component that we’re defining.
For example in our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; component, we want the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HelloWorld&lt;/code&gt; component (through the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HelloWorld&lt;/code&gt; tag), thus we add the components option with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HelloWorld&lt;/code&gt; in there.
These components are local components.
If you would want to write a component that is global, you have to register it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'my-component-name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ... options ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A global component can be accessed anywhere.
Try to avoid this as much as possible as it fills up the global namespace.
An example of a use case that is justified would be an icon library like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FortAwesome/vue-fontawesome&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;faBars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;faCameraRetro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'font-awesome-icon'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;FontAwesomeIcon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this we can access the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;font-awesome-icon&lt;/code&gt; tag from everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;font-awesome-icon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;icon=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;arrow-down&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;4-how-to-write-your-first-component&quot;&gt;4. How to write your first component&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will keep the project as simple as possible for now.
Firstly I will explain the basics of a Vue Component so that you will fully understand what happens when we write our first real component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-structure-of-a-vue-file&quot;&gt;The structure of a .vue file&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-vue highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		...
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'vue-property-decorator'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;HelloWorld&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./components/HelloWorld.vue'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;HelloWorld&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;scss&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;#app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard way to write a Vue component is by using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vue&lt;/code&gt; file extension.
In a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vue&lt;/code&gt; file, we define three optional tags: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;template&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;style&lt;/code&gt;.
According to the Vue documentation, you should always &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/#Single-file-component-top-level-element-order-recommended&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;order the tags consistently&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; being the last one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;templatetemplate&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;…&amp;lt;/template&amp;gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the visual part of your component, in here you define the HTML that will be used to display your component.
Note that your custom HTML should always be surrounded by a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; tag.
The reason for this is that it allows Vue to encapsulate your custom CSS without unknowingly affecting the styling of your whole site.
You can use this to add a custom id or class to the tag to help you identify the component in for example your e2e tests.
Note that a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vue&lt;/code&gt; file can contain at most one &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;template&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;script-langtsscript&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script lang=”ts”&amp;gt;…&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; tag, you can add your custom TypeScript code.
The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lang&lt;/code&gt; attribute is not required but if you do not add it, the default language will be JavaScript.
In order for TypeScript to be available, you need to add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lang=&quot;ts&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.
All of our TypeScript code should be present in this &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; tag, even the import statements.
Note that a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vue&lt;/code&gt; file can contain at most one &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stylestyle&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;…&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; tag we can define our own SCSS specific for this component.
By default, all the styles you define in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; tag are global.
By adding the scoped attribute to our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; tag, our custom SCSS will be specific for that component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-vue highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello World!&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ChildComponent&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ChildComponent&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;scoped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;text-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;italic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the example above, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; tag with the scoped attribute will only affect the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; tag in our component and not the one in our child component.
The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;color: red&lt;/code&gt; styling however will affect also the styling of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; tags in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ChildComponent&lt;/code&gt;.
So it is best to be aware of the implications as it can have unwanted side effects.
For a good way to structure your CSS, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbem.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;BEM methodology&lt;/a&gt; as it will help with avoiding conflicts and will guide you in having clean CSS selectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful though as the scoped attribute leads to a certain performance hit.
Simply by adding the same class or id that we used in the template, we avoid this performance hit and still can have some scoped SCSS.
Note that this will also style the child components.
A &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vue&lt;/code&gt; file can contain more than one &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use global styles, you can either put them in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;App.vue&lt;/code&gt; or create your own CSS file that you import either directly in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; or in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;App.vue&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;should-you-put-everything-in-a-vue-file&quot;&gt;Should you put everything in a .vue file?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For small components, a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vue&lt;/code&gt; file will be very interesting as you have all the elements that make up your component into one specific file.
But what if you have for example lots of lines in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;template&lt;/code&gt; tag?
Or what if you just want to split up the file?
One tactic you can use is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; attribute on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;template&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; and/or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-vue highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;./mycomponent.html&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;./mycomponent.ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;./mycomponent.scss&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I avoid using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; attribute as I like to force myself to keep my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vue&lt;/code&gt; files as small as possible.
There’s also no performance difference between putting the HTML/SCSS separately or in the same &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vue&lt;/code&gt; file.
The Vue CLI will generate the same compiled code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-organise-your-files&quot;&gt;How to organise your files&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-basic-structure&quot;&gt;The basic structure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic project structure in Vue is very simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/public
	/index.html
/src
	/assets
	/components
	App.vue
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this is that you add all your custom components into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/components&lt;/code&gt; and any assets that also need to be transpiled/compiled into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/assets&lt;/code&gt;.
For example a global stylesheet or an icon library that you want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;treeshake&lt;/a&gt; fits perfectly into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/assets&lt;/code&gt;.
In the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder we put all things static that don’t need to be parsed and treeshaked: the logo, the favicons, images, …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-more-advanced-structure&quot;&gt;A more advanced structure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic structure is enough for a simple single page application.
But once you start to have complex pages, things will quickly need to be changed to accommodate the amount of files that you will create.
In a more advanced project (like a personal project of mine), the structure could be like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/public
	/index.html
/src
	/assets
	/components
	/i18n
	/models
	/store
	/views
	App.vue
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project structure, both &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/public&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/assets&lt;/code&gt; provide the same purpose.
I use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/assets&lt;/code&gt; for some local &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.json&lt;/code&gt; files that contain some of my data that is needed in the application.
In &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/components&lt;/code&gt; I keep all my generic components that can be used by pages and other components.
This is what you would put in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SharedModule&lt;/code&gt; in Angular for example.
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/i18n&lt;/code&gt; contains all my translations of my website as well as the initialisation of an i18n library.
Same goes for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/store&lt;/code&gt; that contains my implementation of a store.
I had based myself on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/structure.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;structure proposed in the Vuex library&lt;/a&gt; where they group everything store related into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/store&lt;/code&gt; and applied the same principle for other libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modules&quot;&gt;Modules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vue is designed to be as lightweight as possible and this can be seen in how the basic project is structured: no modules are present.
Vue does support modules but not in the way like we know them from other frameworks like Angular.
Vue modules are simply ES6 modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blogpost-component&quot;&gt;BlogPost component&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-basic-file&quot;&gt;The basic file&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first component we will write is a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BlogPost&lt;/code&gt; component in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;components/BlogPost.vue&lt;/code&gt;.
In a first stage of our little project we will just hardcode a blogpost.
The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BlogPost&lt;/code&gt; component is small:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-vue highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;blogpost&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;meta&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Written by &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;author&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'vue-property-decorator'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;datePosted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BlogPost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;Prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;datePosted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;datePosted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getMonth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;datePosted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getFullYear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;scss&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.blogpost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;text-decoration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;underline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;italic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see the template is rather small.
We’ve grouped all the elements in a div with class &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blogpost&lt;/code&gt;.
Vue expects us to wrap the content in one tag and by convention, they advise to use a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; tag you’ll notice that we have created a small &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/code&gt; interface to wrap our data.
On the component itself, we have a member that is decorated with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@Prop()&lt;/code&gt;.
With the decorator, we allow the use of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BlogPost&lt;/code&gt; component with the attribute &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; that should have type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/code&gt;.
You’ll notice we’ve added a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; behind &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; so we end up with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post!&lt;/code&gt;.
The exclamation mark is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/What's-new-in-TypeScript#non-null-assertion-operator&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;non-null assertion operator&lt;/a&gt; which tells the browser that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; will eventually be filled in with a value and that it shall never be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;BlogPost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;:post=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;blogPost&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blogPost&lt;/code&gt; is an instance of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/code&gt; in our component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we have a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; member which is a computed property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly there is no full type checking going on at the moment.
If we were to use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BlogPost&lt;/code&gt; component, we can always pass along another object into the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; attribute.
We can pass along a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; attribute in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Props&lt;/code&gt; decorator but even that is not that stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;Prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We end the component with our styling in which we make use of SCSS to nest all our styling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-the-blogpost-component&quot;&gt;Using the BlogPost component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have created the BlogPost component but how are we going to actually use it?
We adapt &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;App.vue&lt;/code&gt; as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-vue highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Elke's fantastic blog&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;BlogPost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;v-for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;blogPost in blogPosts&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;:post=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;blogPost&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;:key=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;blogPost.title&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'vue-property-decorator'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BlogPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./components/BlogPost.vue'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BlogPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;blogPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;

		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

			&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Hurray for me, this is my second post!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Elke'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Another one?!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Another one!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Elke'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;datePosted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;scss&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;#app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Avenir'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Helvetica&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Arial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;-webkit-font-smoothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;antialiased&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;-moz-osx-font-smoothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grayscale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mh&quot;&gt;#2c3e50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin-top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;60px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see we define a property on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; component that contains our blog posts, we add the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;components&lt;/code&gt; property to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/code&gt; decorator and add the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BlogPost&lt;/code&gt; tag in the template.
We simply loop over the blog posts with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v-for&lt;/code&gt; directive.
We pass each blog post to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BlogPost&lt;/code&gt; component by binding it to the correct data attribute.
This can be done through &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v-bind:post=&quot;blogPost&quot;&lt;/code&gt; but we use the shorthand method of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:post=&quot;blogPost&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.
Vue transforms &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:post&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v-bind:post&lt;/code&gt; behind the screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we also pass &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:key&lt;/code&gt; which we bind to the title of our blog post.
The reason for this is that it allows Vue to keep track of the state of the list by only looking at the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:key&lt;/code&gt; attribute instead of having to deep compare objects.
Try to have an unique key of type number or string that can be used for actions such as identifying, ordering and searching.
A blog post title is a good start but when ordering, updating or other modifying operations you might not have the wanted result if we have blog posts with the same title.
It’s best to use something of type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; as the key.
Vue will tell you this in the console of your browser if you would take for example the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;datePosted&lt;/code&gt; as your key:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/vue-key-typing-error.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason behind this is that Vue relies on the built-in sort and find functionalities of JavaScript.
For objects, Vue can not do this natively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we serve our app with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npm run serve
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see in our browser:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/wordvue-first-impression.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit-contain&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great, you’ve written your first working component!
Now it is time to extend it with some functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-conditional-elements-to-the-component&quot;&gt;Adding conditional elements to the component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important part of a component is to have some dynamic behaviour.
For example what if we want to show a highlighted blog post? 
We could create a new component called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HighlightedBlogPost&lt;/code&gt; but we could also extend our existing component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can add a new paragraph with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v-if&lt;/code&gt; statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;v-if=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;post.highlighted&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This post is highlighted!&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contents of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v-if&lt;/code&gt; is a TypeScript statement that should return &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.
We extend our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/code&gt; interface to accomodate this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;datePosted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;highlighted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;highlighted: true,&lt;/code&gt; to the second blog post in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;App.vue&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our browser it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/wordvue-conditional-elements.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit-contain&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We end up with this as our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BlogPost&lt;/code&gt; component:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-vue highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;blogpost&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;scss&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.blogpost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;text-decoration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;underline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;italic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-conditional-css-to-our-component&quot;&gt;Adding conditional CSS to our component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know how to add a conditional element to our component, but we can also have conditional CSS.
We will use this conditional CSS so our highlighted blog post is also visually highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can add in our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; with class &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blogpost&lt;/code&gt; an extra &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v-bind&lt;/code&gt; directive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;blogpost&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;v-bind:class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{ highlighted: post.highlighted }&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v-bind&lt;/code&gt; we define to which attribute we want to bind after the colon.
So in our case, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v-bind:class&lt;/code&gt; results in a binding with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; attribute in our HTML.
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v-bind:class&lt;/code&gt; accepts an object as parameter in which each key should be mapped to a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;.
For each key that is mapped to a truthy value, that key is added as a class to the HTML tag on which the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v-bind&lt;/code&gt; is located.
You will notice that we use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v-bind&lt;/code&gt; to bind to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; attribute but that this attribute already exists on our HTML element.
This is no problem as Vue will simply concatenate all the values.
In the case that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post.highlighted&lt;/code&gt; is truthy, we will thus end up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;blogpost highlighted&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when it is falsy, we end up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;blogpost&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We extend our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.blogpost&lt;/code&gt; to give the blog posts a width, center them and add a border with a background:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.blogpost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;400px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;.highlighted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#f4d942&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#fff3b2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our browser it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/wordvue-conditional-css.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit-contain&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we also have a shorter version of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v-bind:attributename&lt;/code&gt; which is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:attributename&lt;/code&gt;.
So we can shorten &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v-bind:class&lt;/code&gt; to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;blogpost&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;:class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{ highlighted: post.highlighted }&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We end up with this as our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BlogPost&lt;/code&gt; component:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-vue highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;blogpost&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;:class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;{ highlighted: post.highlighted }&quot;&amp;gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;v-if=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;post.highlighted&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This post is highlighted!&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;meta&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Written by &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;author&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'vue-property-decorator'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mh&quot;&gt;#f4d942&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mh&quot;&gt;#fff3b2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;text-decoration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;underline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;italic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-events-in-a-component&quot;&gt;Using events in a component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final extension to our blog, we also want to add some dynamic behaviour by reacting to events.
For our example, we will bind a button to the click event in our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; component with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v-on:click&lt;/code&gt; directive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;v-on:click=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;toggleHighlightedPostsVisibility&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Show/hide highlighted posts&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The syntax to bind to events is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v-on:eventname&lt;/code&gt;.
We can also use the shorthand version which is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@eventname&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;click=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;toggleHighlightedPostsVisibility&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Show/hide highlighted posts&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we write the event handler along with some variables in our component.
The code block is followed by an explanation about what we have done exactly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;showHighlighted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;blogPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;visibleBlogPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;blogPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;highlighted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;highlighted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;showHighlighted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toggleHighlightedPostsVisibility&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;showHighlighted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;showHighlighted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First what we did was add the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;showHighlighted&lt;/code&gt; boolean.
This is to keep track whether we should show or hide the highlighted blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also wrote a getter to only show the blog posts that are allowed to be shown.
In our filter, we check if the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;highlighted&lt;/code&gt; member is defined and if so, we check if it equals our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;showHighlighted&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why we write this in a getter, is that we want to avoid putting business logic in our template.
Thus we opt for writing a getter which is the equivalent of a computed property in Vue JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this we have to adapt the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v-for&lt;/code&gt; in our template so that we use the new getter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;BlogPost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;v-for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;blogPost in visibleBlogPosts&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;:post=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;blogPost&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;:key=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;blogPost.title&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a small bonus, we will make the text in our button dynamic.
Currently we have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Show/hide highlighted posts&lt;/code&gt; as the text but it would be cleaner if we showed &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Show highlighted posts&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hide highlighted posts&lt;/code&gt; depending on the state of the component.
We update the button to the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;click=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;toggleHighlightedPostsVisibility&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ showHighlighted ? 'Hide' : 'Show' }} highlighted posts&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we end up visually with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/wordvue-events-showhide.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; component looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-vue highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Elke's fantastic blog&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;click=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;toggleHighlightedPostsVisibility&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;showHighlighted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Hide'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Show'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt; highlighted posts&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;BlogPost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;v-for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;blogPost in visibleBlogPosts&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;:post=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;blogPost&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;:key=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;blogPost.title&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'vue-property-decorator'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BlogPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./components/BlogPost.vue'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BlogPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mh&quot;&gt;#2c3e50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin-top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;60px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;5-using-your-first-plugin&quot;&gt;5. Using your first plugin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vue comes without any libraries, it is a super clean and lean framework where even functionality for HTTP calls is not present.
However, every component is a Vue object and can be extended with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$http&lt;/code&gt; member that you can use in your code to perform HTTP calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide this &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$http&lt;/code&gt; member, we have to add the correct plugin to our code.
In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;awesome-vue project on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, we can find an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue#http-requests&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;extensive list of HTTP plugins&lt;/a&gt;.
We will use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/axios/axios&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;axios&lt;/a&gt; as our HTTP library but we will use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/imcvampire/vue-axios&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;vue-axios&lt;/a&gt; for the bindings with Vue in TypeScript as axios does not provide the necessary typings for axios in Vue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;installing-a-plugin&quot;&gt;Installing a plugin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We follow the installation instructions for vue-axios which are pretty straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npm i axios vue-axios
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you noticed we also installed axios.
This is because vue-axios only focuses on the TypeScript bindings for Vue and does not include the actual axios library.
Vue-axios basically turns the axios library into a plugin compatible for Vue.
After that, we have to signal to Vue that we want to use this plugin.
We add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Vue.use(plugin, options)&lt;/code&gt; statement in our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main.ts&lt;/code&gt; so it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'axios'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'vue'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;VueAxios&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'vue-axios'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./App.vue'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;productionTip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;VueAxios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$mount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'#app'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important part is that we put the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Vue.use(...)&lt;/code&gt; statement before we actually bootstrap the application with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;new Vue(...)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-effect-of-adding-a-plugin&quot;&gt;The effect of adding a plugin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have added a plugin, but what does that actually mean?
What is the effect on our Vue code?
The main effect is that we now have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$http&lt;/code&gt; accessible in every Vue component.
This means that we can now have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this.$http&lt;/code&gt; in our classes in which a unique instance of the axios library for the whole application will be plugged.
When we check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/master/index.d.ts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;typings&lt;/a&gt;  from axios, we find that we now have methods like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get(...)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post(...)&lt;/code&gt; and many more default REST methods available in our code through the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$http&lt;/code&gt; member in which an instance of axios is present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get(...)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post(...)&lt;/code&gt; will also exist on other HTTP libraries that we can add to Vue.
It is not obliged by Vue to provide these same functionalities in another HTTP library.
But it makes sense for library creators to comply to the standard set by the HTTP library of preference as chosen by Vue, in this case axios.
Otherwise it would not be easy to change certain libraries for another one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-the-axios-plugin-for-performing-http-calls&quot;&gt;Using the axios plugin for performing HTTP calls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Vue component has &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html#Instance-Lifecycle-Hooks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;multiple lifecycle hooks&lt;/a&gt; with the most interesting ones for what we want to do: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;created()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mounted()&lt;/code&gt;.
Created is called by Vue when the object is created: reactive data is set up, event callbacks are ready and the object is not yet mounted on the DOM.
The Vue object will thus be ready to go but it will not yet be visible to the user.
The mounted hook is used for when the element is mounted into the HTML DOM, which means the rendering is performed by the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-vue highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		...
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'vue-property-decorator'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons why we want to start our HTTP calls in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;created&lt;/code&gt; method.
The first reason is that we can limit the amount of time the user has to wait for data to be loaded and shown on the screen.
The second one is that the mounted hook is not called when we would use serverside rendering.
To ensure that our code is compatible with all use cases, we place the HTTP calls in the created method of our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;App.vue&lt;/code&gt; which results in this component:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-vue highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see we have added a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;private created&lt;/code&gt; method since this should not be publicly available to other components.
We call an API and map the response into our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/code&gt; array.
Now we need to set up our API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-we-have-set-up-a-local-api&quot;&gt;How we have set up a local API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simulate a real API call, we set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/typicode/json-server&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;json-server&lt;/a&gt;, a small tool that launches a web server with a REST API that serves a JSON file which we call &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;db.json&lt;/code&gt; present in our assets folder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

			&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;datePosted&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;2019-01-18&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
		&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
		&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
			&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Look I am blogging!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
		&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
			&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Another one?!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
			&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;body&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Another one!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
			&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;author&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Elke&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
			&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;datePosted&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;2019-01-20&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
		&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We install json-server with NPM and then we launch it with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npm i json-server
$ json-server src/assets/db.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, json-server will launch on port 3000.
When we launch wordvue and open it in the browser, we will see that the blog posts are now coming from our local API.
Now you know how to install a plugin and retrieve data with axios over HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;6-your-first-deployment&quot;&gt;6. Your first deployment&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;development-mode-versus-production-mode&quot;&gt;Development mode versus production mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like other frontend frameworks, Vue has its development mode and production mode. The development mode is available with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npm run serve
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While production mode is available with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npm run build
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what is the difference between both modes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Development mode&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Production mode&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;CSS &amp;amp; HTML bundled into JS&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;CSS separately, HTML bundled into JS&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Warnings in console&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;No warnings in console&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Additional checks to identify warnings&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;No additional checks, ignores any situation that would trigger warnings&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Everything in one &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Separate &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vendor.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Heavy use of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; for hot reload&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;No use of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt;, no hot reloading necessary&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Basic bundling of all code, use of minified libraries only when available&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Bundling &amp;amp; maximum minification&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;No minification of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Minification of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vendor.js&lt;/code&gt;: Contains all the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; code that your project uses&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt;: JavaScript function that executes strings as if it’s a line of code and should &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#Do_not_ever_use_eval!&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;never be used in production&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the minification, avoiding the use of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt;, removing of warning checks and so on results in a much smaller size of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we do a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm run serve&lt;/code&gt; and check our Developer Tools in Chrome, we see the size of our application:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/wordvue-size-serve.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In development mode, our application is more than 2MB large. We see the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; alongside a generated &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; that contains all our own code and all the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; that we are using.
While when we build with the production mode via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm run build&lt;/code&gt;, we get an application that is in total less than 125KB:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/wordvue-size-build.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing we changed to get a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; folder that is so small, was adding a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vue.config.js&lt;/code&gt; file in the root of our folder which exports an object with the settings we want:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;productionSourceMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only had to add the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;productionSourceMap&lt;/code&gt; set to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; to disable the creation of source maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More configurations can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://cli.vuejs.org/config/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;cli.vuejs.org&lt;/a&gt; but most of the configuration is already done for a maximum optimised production build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-for-production&quot;&gt;Building for production&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When running the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm run build&lt;/code&gt; command, you’ll get the following output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/vue-with-typescript/vue-cli-build.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what the Vue CLI does is take all the SCSS out of the components and minifies it, compiles all the components into an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; file and &lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;treeshakes&lt;/a&gt;  all used libraries into a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;chunk-vendors.js&lt;/code&gt; file.
After that, it Gzips all those files to ensure that everything is as light as possible.
If you have any assets, it will also clone those into the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a dist folder which contents you can directly deploy onto your favourite server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;7-conclusion&quot;&gt;7. Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you have built your very first Vue application with TypeScript!
The end result can be found in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ordina-jworks/vue-typescript-wordvue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;  so you can see the working version.
You now know how to write a basic component with the use of decorators, create a component structure and fill it with data coming from an API.
After that you can also deploy it onto a server.
A next step would be to add routing, add a store or an i18n library.
Vue is a lightweight framework that primarily focuses on visualisation.
If you want to add more functionality, you will have to rely on plugins who either support Vue integration directly or you can use a plugin like vue-axios that will facilitate the integration of another library like axios.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my consultancy projects, I often come across the same implementations and problems when colleagues are trying to implement an observable strategy.
A lot of frameworks are offering observables out of the box for their communication layer.
Almost all &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Promises&lt;/code&gt; are replaced by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Observables&lt;/code&gt; nowadays.
Angular 2+ &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HttpModule&lt;/code&gt; for example, is using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rxjs&lt;/code&gt; library.
Each &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http.get()&lt;/code&gt; is returning an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Observable&amp;lt;HttpResponse&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setup is almost always the same.
A (visual) component needs to render some data.
So next to the component (HTML/template for view, and a JavaScript(TypeScript) component as the controller), a service gets created.
This service’s purpose is to provide data to the component’s controller by calling the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HttpClient&lt;/code&gt;’s functions (POST, GET, DELETE, PATCH, …) and returning the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt; to the component.
Sometimes they are remapping the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Observable&amp;lt;HttpReponse&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;to a more defined type, for example &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Observable&amp;lt;MyData&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, by using one of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rxjs&lt;/code&gt; operators such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flatmap&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, … .
All of this works pretty well, as long as only one component is in need of the data and its changes.
With changes, I refer to refreshing the data, or requerying it with another filter, paging, or …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/observables-the-right-way/first-step.png&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time the query parameters change, the component is just executing the same call in the service, which in turn is calling the right &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HttpClient&lt;/code&gt;-function.
Again an (new) &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt; is returned.
Again the result can get remapped before throttling it back.
The subscriber, the component controller in this case (or the HTML if you are using Angular’s async pipe), receives the remapped data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when we have another component that is in need of this data (or maybe just a part of it)?
Let’s say we have a header and a datatable.
And we are NOT using push events, but simple REST calls (for the sake of this explanation).
The datatable is the component we were talking about earlier.
It needs to display messages in a simple datatable.
The header is the second component that needs this data.
It needs to display the number of unread or critical messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;datatable.component.ts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_dataService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;header.component.ts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_dataService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'x-count'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the setup we have so far, both components will use the same service for requesting the data.
They will both subscribe to an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt;, however, it will be a different one.
When you refresh the data in the datatable, the header will not receive a new value in its subscription and therefore will still show the old number of messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some use cases this might be the desired outcome, but in most cases you want more components to be able to subscribe to the same &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;setup&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our new setup, we want both, header and datatable, to subscribe to the same Observable, so a call for new data will result in an update in the datatable and the header.
To make this happen, we will use some kind of layer in between them.
This new layer will provide our components with one and only one and the same &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt; and will mask the communication layer from the view’s controller.
Both components will subscribe to this service, so they both get updated with the same result.
We can do this by creating a simple &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Subject&lt;/code&gt; in our service and returning it as an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt; to our components.
We can then implement other calls for this service that will trigger an update of the data, and send it through the subject to both components.
Because we are not providing a filter when we call the getter for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Subject&lt;/code&gt;) we should also find a way of providing the filter to the service, before requerying the data.
This means we are going to use one shared filter, for both components, which makes sense in this case, but not in all use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/observables-the-right-way/second-step.png&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;refactoring&quot;&gt;Refactoring&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We actually don’t need to refactor any of our components.
They will still subscribe to an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt; of the service, and react on the incoming data.
The service however will get refactored.
Start by defining the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Subject&lt;/code&gt; as a local property, and because we are going to implement a getter, we can make it private.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;data.service.ts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_data$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BehaviorSubject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_data$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'urlToData'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;parseFilterToString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;tap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;logService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'x-count'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_data$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, every component or service that is subscribing on this subject, is getting data when some other component or service triggers the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reload&lt;/code&gt;.
There are even a lot more options to this setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clearing data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resetting to default filter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refreshing the current filter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Caching data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manipulating data through other services or components&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding an event consumer that also updates the datatable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve build a simple example to demonstrate this behaviour.
A header that is displaying an alert icon when there are unread, critical messages.
A sidebar that is displaying the amount of unread messages next to its navigation link, and an overview of the messages, with a basic paging implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/observables-the-right-way/example.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple backend that is written in Node.js with Express provides a few endpoints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;api/message&lt;/code&gt; (with paging and filter, although the filter isn’t implemented in the frontend example.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;api/message/:id&lt;/code&gt; (not used in the example)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;api/stream&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;api/refresh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service is not reloading data as long as the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; or the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; hasn’t changed.
While the service is still loading the data, a new reload will not fetch again the data.
You can find the code on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/VeeTeeDev/observables-demo&quot;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/observables-the-right-way/example-setup.png&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Server-Sent Events are added to update the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; status of a message when the envelope gets clicked.
This will also trigger the observable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To run front- and backend together, execute the following command in the root of the project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$ npm run start&lt;/code&gt;
This way, a proxy is added to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;serve&lt;/code&gt; command to overcome &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CORS&lt;/code&gt; blocking going from localhost:4200 to localhost:3000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t mind the backend server, it’s a quick and dirty solution and is not implemented as it should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although observables are a great feature, and are easy to use, it’s always better to have your own layer of control.
Especially when it comes to using observables from frameworks.
I can accept, for simple applications, that you don’t want to ‘over-architect’.
But in most cases, you want to control the distribution yourself.
For those of you that know &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Redux&lt;/code&gt; (RxJS), you can compare this implementation with effects and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;-subscriptions.
If you trigger an effect, you will only see the result when you have subscribed to the ‘key’ that is responsible for providing you with the data,
and not to the ‘key’ that is responsible for triggering the effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;first_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Tim&quot;, &quot;last_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Vierbergen&quot;, &quot;permalink&quot;=&gt;&quot;/author/tim-vierbergen/&quot;, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;&quot;tim-vierbergen.jpg&quot;, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;&quot;vierbergentim&quot;, &quot;linkedin&quot;=&gt;&quot;tim-vierbergen-82557834&quot;, &quot;github&quot;=&gt;&quot;VeeTeeDev&quot;, &quot;title&quot;=&gt;&quot;Software Engineer&quot;, &quot;title2&quot;=&gt;&quot;Principal Consultant &amp; Competence Lead CI/CD&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;tim.vierbergen@ordina.be&quot;, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Tim is a senior developer and architect at JWorks Ordina Belgium.

&lt;h1 id=&quot;infrastructure-as-code&quot;&gt;Infrastructure as Code&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a way of managing your devices and servers through machine-readable definition files. 
Basically, you write down how you want your infrastructure to look like and what code should be run on that infrastructure. 
Then, with the push of a button you say “Deploy my infrastructure”. 
BAM, there is your application, running on a server, against a database, available through an API, ready to be used!
And you just defined all of that infrastructure using IaC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;IaC is a key practice of DEVOPS teams and integrates as part of the CI/CD pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great Infrastructure as Code tool is Terraform by HashiCorp.
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.terraform.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.terraform.io/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
Personally I use it to provide and maintain infrastructure on AWS.
And I’ve had a great experience doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019-01-14-Infrastructure-as-code-with-terraform-and-aws-serverless/overview.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction-and-demo&quot;&gt;Introduction and demo&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will demonstrate IaC by working out an example. 
We are going to set up an application on AWS.
I provisioned the code on GitLab: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/nxtra/codingtips-blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://gitlab.com/nxtra/codingtips-blog&lt;/a&gt;.
A user can enter a coding tip and see all the coding tips that other users have entered.
The tips are stored in a NoSQL database which is AWS DynamoDB.
Storing and retrieving these tips is done by the Lambda Functions which fetch or put the tips from and to the database.
For the application to be useful, users have to be able to call these Lambda Functions.
So we expose the Lambda Functions through AWS API Gateway. 
Here is an architectural overview of the application:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019-01-14-Infrastructure-as-code-with-terraform-and-aws-serverless/AWS-Serverless-Architecture.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could couple these functions to a web page where users can enter tips and see all tips that have been given.
Below you see the final result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019-01-14-Infrastructure-as-code-with-terraform-and-aws-serverless/demo.gif&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;creating-the-application&quot;&gt;Creating the application&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will now go over the steps to set up the application you see in the demo above.
IaC is the main focus.
I will show the code and AWS CLI commands that are necessary but I will not explain them in detail since that is not the purpose of this blog.
I’ll focus on the Terraform definitions instead.
You are welcome to follow along by cloning the repository that I linked to in this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;prerequisites&quot;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install Terraform&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install AWS CLI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Checkout the repository on GitLab: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/nxtra/codingtips-blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://gitlab.com/nxtra/codingtips-blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be ready to get your mind blown by IaC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;terraform-the-basics&quot;&gt;Terraform: the basics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main things you’ll be configuring with Terraform are resources.
Resources are the components of your application infrastructure.
E.g: a Lambda Function, an API Gateway Deployment, a DynamoDB database, …
A resource is defined by using the keyword &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;resource&lt;/code&gt; followed by the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;.
The name can be arbitrarily chosen.
The type is fixed.
For example:
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;resource &quot;aws_dynamodb_table&quot; &quot;codingtips-dynamodb-table&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To follow along with this blog post you have to know two basic Terraform commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;terraform apply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terraform apply will start provisioning all the infrastructure you defined.
Your databases will be created.
Your Lambda Functions will be set up.
The API Gateway will be set in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;terraform destroy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terraform destroy will remove all the infrastructure that you have set up in the cloud.
If you are using Terraform correctly you should not have to use this command.
However should you want to start over, you can remove all the existing infrastructure with this command.
No worries, you will still have all the infrastructure neatly described on your machine because you are using Infrastructure as Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll put all infrastructure that is defined using Terraform in the same folder.
The files need to have a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.tf&lt;/code&gt; extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;general&quot;&gt;General&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start out by creating a file &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;general.tf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-hcl-terraform&quot;&gt;provider &quot;aws&quot; {
  region = &quot;eu-west-1&quot;
}

# variables
variable &quot;lambda_version&quot;     { default = &quot;1.0.0&quot;}
variable &quot;s3_bucket&quot;          { default = &quot;codingtips-node-bucket&quot;}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;provider&lt;/code&gt; block specifies that we are deploying on AWS.
You also have the possibility to mention credentials that will be used for deploying here.
If you have correctly set up the AWS CLI on your machine there will be default credentials in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.aws&lt;/code&gt; folder.
If no credentials are specified, Terraform will use these default credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variables have a name which we can reference from anywhere in our Terraform configuration. 
For example we could reference the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;s3_bucket&lt;/code&gt; variable with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;${var.s3_bucket)&lt;/code&gt;.
This is handy when you are using the same variable in multiple places.
I will not use too many variables throughout this blog post since that will add more references to your Terraform configuration and I want it to be as clear as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;database-dynamodb&quot;&gt;Database: DynamoDB&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019-01-14-Infrastructure-as-code-with-terraform-and-aws-serverless/icon-DynamoDB.png&quot; width=&quot;15%&quot; height=&quot;15%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the basis.
Where will all our coding tips be stored? 
That’s right, in the database.
This database is part of our infrastructure and will be defined in a file I named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dynamo.tf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-hcl-terraform&quot;&gt;resource &quot;aws_dynamodb_table&quot; &quot;codingtips-dynamodb-table&quot; {
  name = &quot;CodingTips&quot;
  read_capacity = 5
  write_capacity = 5
  hash_key = &quot;Author&quot;
  range_key = &quot;Date&quot;

  attribute = [
    {
      name = &quot;Author&quot;
      type = &quot;S&quot;
    },
    {
      name = &quot;Date&quot;
      type = &quot;N&quot;
    }]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Dynamo is a NoSQL database, we don’t have to specify all attributes upfront.
The only thing we have to provide are the elements that AWS will use to build the partition key with.
When you provide a hash key as well as a sort key, AWS will combine these to make a unique partition key.
Mind the word UNIQUE.
Make sure this combination is unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;DynamoDB uses the partition key value as input to an internal hash function. 
The output from the hash function determines the partition (physical storage internal to DynamoDB) in which the item will be stored. 
All items with the same partition key value are stored together, in sorted order by sort key value.
– from AWS docs: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.CoreComponents.html&quot;&gt;DynamoDB Core Components&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the attribute definitions in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dynamo.tf&lt;/code&gt; it is clear that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Author&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;) is a string and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;) should be a number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;iam&quot;&gt;IAM&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019-01-14-Infrastructure-as-code-with-terraform-and-aws-serverless/icon-IAM.png&quot; width=&quot;15%&quot; height=&quot;15%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before specifying the Lambda Functions we have to create permissions for our functions to use.
This makes sure that our functions have permissions to access other resources (like DynamoDB).
Without going too deep into it, the AWS permission model works as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide a resource with a role&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add permissions to this role&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These allow the role to access other resources:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;permissions for triggering another resource (eg. Lambda Function forwards logs to CloudWatch)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;permissions for being triggered by another resource (eg. Lambda Function may be triggered by API Gateway)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-hcl-terraform&quot;&gt;# ROLES
# IAM role which dictates what other AWS services the Lambda function
# may access.
resource &quot;aws_iam_role&quot; &quot;lambda-iam-role&quot; {
  name = &quot;codingtips_lambda_role&quot;

  assume_role_policy = &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF
{
  &quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;,
  &quot;Statement&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;Action&quot;: &quot;sts:AssumeRole&quot;,
      &quot;Principal&quot;: {
        &quot;Service&quot;: &quot;lambda.amazonaws.com&quot;
      },
      &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,
      &quot;Sid&quot;: &quot;&quot;
    }
  ]
}
EOF
}

# POLICIES
resource &quot;aws_iam_role_policy&quot; &quot;dynamodb-lambda-policy&quot;{
  name = &quot;dynamodb_lambda_policy&quot;
  role = &quot;${aws_iam_role.lambda-iam-role.id}&quot;
  policy = &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF
{
  &quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;,
  &quot;Statement&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,
      &quot;Action&quot;: [
        &quot;dynamodb:*&quot;
      ],
      &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;${aws_dynamodb_table.codingtips-dynamodb-table.arn}&quot;
    }
  ]
}
EOF
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the example above, the first resource that is defined is an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aws_iam_role&lt;/code&gt;.
This is the role that we will later give to our Lambda Functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then create the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aws_iam_role_policy&lt;/code&gt; resource which we link to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aws_iam_role&lt;/code&gt;.
The first &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aws_iam_role_policy&lt;/code&gt; is giving this role permission to invoke any action on the specified DynamoDB resource.
The second &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;role_policy&lt;/code&gt; allows a resource with this role to send logs to CloudWatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of things to notice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aws_iam_role&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aws_iam_role_policy&lt;/code&gt; are connected by the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;role&lt;/code&gt; argument of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;role_policy&lt;/code&gt; resource&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aws_iam_role_policy&lt;/code&gt; we grant (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/code&gt; attr.) permission to do some actions (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Action&lt;/code&gt; attr.) on a certain resource (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Resource&lt;/code&gt; attr.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A resource is referenced by its &lt;em&gt;ARN&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Amazon Resource Name&lt;/em&gt; which uniquely identifies this resource on AWS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are two ways to specify an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aws_iam_role_policy&lt;/code&gt;:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;using the &lt;em&gt;until EOF&lt;/em&gt; syntax (like I did here)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;using a separate Terraform &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aws_iam_policy_document&lt;/code&gt; element that is coupled to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aws_iam_role_policy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dynamodb-lambda-policy&lt;/code&gt; allows all actions on the specified DynamoDB resource because under the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Action&lt;/code&gt; attribute it states &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dynamodb:*&lt;/code&gt;
You could make this more restricted and mention actions like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;dynamodb:Scan&quot;, &quot;dynamodb:BatchWriteItem&quot;,&quot;dynamodb:PutItem&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lambda-functions&quot;&gt;Lambda Functions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019-01-14-Infrastructure-as-code-with-terraform-and-aws-serverless/icon-Lambda.png&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two Lambda Functions that are part of this application.
The first Lambda is used to get or retrieve the coding tips from the database further referenced as the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getLambda&lt;/code&gt;.
The second Lambda is used to post or send the coding tips to the database further referenced as the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;postlambda&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not going to copy paste the code of the Lambda Functions in here.
You can check it out in the repository linked to this blog 
(GitLab repository: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/nxtra/codingtips-blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://gitlab.com/nxtra/codingtips-blog&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I will demonstrate the example of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getLambda&lt;/code&gt; function.
The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;postLambda&lt;/code&gt; is deployed in the same way and you can find the Terraform definitions in the Git repository.
A Lambda Function is a little different from the other infrastructure we defined here.
Not only do we need a Lambda Function as infrastructure.
We also need to specify the code that runs in this Lambda Function.
But where will AWS find that specific code when deploying the Lambda Function?
They don’t have access to your local machine, have they?
That is why you first need to ship your code to a S3 Bucket on AWS where it can be found when your Function is being deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That also means creating an S3 Bucket, which you can do with this command when you want it in region &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;eu-west-1&lt;/code&gt; (Ireland):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;aws s3api create-bucket &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--bucket&lt;/span&gt; codingtips-node-bucket &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--region&lt;/span&gt; eu-west-1 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--create-bucket-configuration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;LocationConstraint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;eu-west-1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have to zip the code of your Lambda Functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;zip &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-r&lt;/span&gt; getLambda.zip index.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And upload that file to s3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;aws s3 &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cp &lt;/span&gt;getLambda.zip s3://codingtips-node-bucket/v1.0.0/getLambda.zip
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind that I am sending it to a bucket named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;codingtips-node-bucket&lt;/code&gt; in a folder &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v1.0.0&lt;/code&gt; with filename &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getLambda.zip&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, the code is where it needs to be.
Now let’s see how we specify these functions using Terraform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-hcl-terraform&quot;&gt;resource &quot;aws_lambda_function&quot; &quot;get-tips-lambda&quot; {
  function_name = &quot;codingTips-get&quot;

  # The bucket name as created earlier with &quot;aws s3api create-bucket&quot;
  s3_bucket = &quot;${var.s3_bucket}&quot;
  s3_key = &quot;v${var.lambda_version}/getLambda.zip&quot;

  # &quot;main&quot; is the filename within the zip file (index.js) and &quot;handler&quot;
  # is the name of the property under which the handler function was
  # exported in that file.
  handler = &quot;index.handler&quot;
  runtime = &quot;nodejs8.10&quot;
  memory_size = 128

  role = &quot;${aws_iam_role.lambda-iam-role.arn}&quot;
}

resource &quot;aws_lambda_permission&quot; &quot;api-gateway-invoke-get-lambda&quot; {
  statement_id  = &quot;AllowAPIGatewayInvoke&quot;
  action        = &quot;lambda:InvokeFunction&quot;
  function_name = &quot;${aws_lambda_function.get-tips-lambda.arn}&quot;
  principal     = &quot;apigateway.amazonaws.com&quot;

  # The /*/* portion grants access from any method on any resource
  # within the specified API Gateway.
  source_arn = &quot;${aws_api_gateway_deployment.codingtips-api-gateway-deployment.execution_arn}/*/*&quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Notice that we tell Terraform the S3 Bucket and directory to look for the code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We specify the runtime and memory for this Lambda Function&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.handler&lt;/code&gt; points to the file and function where to enter the code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aws_lambda_permission&lt;/code&gt; resource is the permission that states that this Lambda Function may be invoked by the API Gateway that we created&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;api-gateway&quot;&gt;API Gateway&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019-01-14-Infrastructure-as-code-with-terraform-and-aws-serverless/icon-apigateway.png&quot; width=&quot;15%&quot; height=&quot;15%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept the most difficult one for last.
On the other hand, it is also the most interesting.
I hand Terraform a &lt;em&gt;Swagger&lt;/em&gt; definition of my API.
You can also do this without Swagger, but then you will have to specify a lot more resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Swagger API definition looks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;swagger: '2.0'

        description: &quot;category of the coding tip&quot;
    required:
      - tip
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not know Swagger yet, copy the above and paste it in the online (&lt;a href=&quot;https://editor.swagger.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Swagger Editor&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will grant you a nice visual overview of the API definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019-01-14-Infrastructure-as-code-with-terraform-and-aws-serverless/swagger.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; height=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only one AWS specific thing in the Swagger specification above and that is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x-amazon-apigateway-integration&lt;/code&gt;.
This is specifying the details of how the API is integrating with the backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remark that this is always a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; even if the HTTP method of the resource path is a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aws_proxy&lt;/code&gt; means that the request is passed to the Lambda Function without manipulation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;when_no_match&lt;/code&gt; passes the request body to the backend without tranforming it when no &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;requestTemplate&lt;/code&gt; is specified for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;uri&lt;/code&gt; is referencing a variable eg. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;${get_lambda_arn}&lt;/code&gt; that Terraform passes to the Swagger definition.
We’ll see this in a minute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I already mentioned, using Swagger to define your API Gateway has some advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It keeps your Terraform more concise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can use this Swagger to get a nice representation of your API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-hcl-terraform&quot;&gt;resource &quot;aws_api_gateway_rest_api&quot; &quot;codingtips-api-gateway&quot; {
  name        = &quot;CodingTipsAPI&quot;
  description = &quot;API to access codingtips application&quot;
  body        = &quot;${data.template_file.codingtips_api_swagger.rendered}&quot;
}

data &quot;template_file&quot; codingtips_api_swagger{
  template = &quot;${file(&quot;swagger.yaml&quot;)}&quot;

  vars {
    get_lambda_arn = &quot;${aws_lambda_function.get-tips-lambda.invoke_arn}&quot;
    post_lambda_arn = &quot;${aws_lambda_function.post-tips-lambda.invoke_arn}&quot;
  }
}

resource &quot;aws_api_gateway_deployment&quot; &quot;codingtips-api-gateway-deployment&quot; {
  rest_api_id = &quot;${aws_api_gateway_rest_api.codingtips-api-gateway.id}&quot;
  stage_name  = &quot;default&quot;
}

output &quot;url&quot; {
  value = &quot;${aws_api_gateway_deployment.codingtips-api-gateway-deployment.invoke_url}/api&quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We start by mentioning the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aws_api_gateway_rest_api&lt;/code&gt; resource.
It does what is says and provides an API Gateway REST API.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;body references the Swagger file&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;template_file&lt;/code&gt; datasource allows Terraform to use information that is not defined in Terraform (Swagger in our case)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Variables are passed to this &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;template_file&lt;/code&gt; to fill the file&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For a given &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rest-api&lt;/code&gt; to be usable, it has to be deployed
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is done by the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aws_api_gateway_deployment&lt;/code&gt; resource&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It references the REST API&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It needs a stage which is like a ‘version’ or ‘snapshot’ of your API
The stage name will be in the URL to invoke this API.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At last the URL on which the API can be invoked is outputted to the terminal
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/api&lt;/code&gt; is appended to have the correct resource path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;endgame&quot;&gt;Endgame&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right, let’s see it now.
Does this actually work?
Here I am running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;terraform apply&lt;/code&gt; within the repository linked to this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019-01-14-Infrastructure-as-code-with-terraform-and-aws-serverless/apply.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice, it worked.
And I only told Terraform about the infrastructure I wanted.
The whole setup process goes automatically!
You can now use the outputted URL to GET and POST coding tips.
The body of the POST should look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;author&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Nick&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;tip&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Short sessions with frequent brakes&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;category&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Empowerment&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you need to couple the API endpoints to a frontend of your own design, you need to set the CORS headers correctly.
If you want this challenge, there is another branch in the repository (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cors-enabled&lt;/code&gt;) where I worked this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding folks, Code that Infrastructure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile development has always intrigued me.
Bringing data to life by visualizing it with different components and being able to carry your app along inside your pocket is something special.
I still remember the excitement I felt when working on my first mobile app in university,
even with the lack of good resources back then and the sluggish emulator which was available at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mobile world has kept expanding with big improvements in resources, frameworks, tools and designs.
From the first iPhone to having your refrigerator running your favorite apps, more and more possibilities and challenges have become available to keep you going.
Nowadays, there are different paths that you can follow to create those apps.
Native, hybrid or web apps, it all depends on what you want to achieve and how many resources are available.
Each has its benefits and pitfalls, which doesn’t make the decision any easier.
Do you want to give your audience the best native experience with great performance?
Or does a hybrid app suffices where you might compromise in speed and in look &amp;amp; feel of a native app?
Flutter might be the answer, by providing you the best parts of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beautiful-native-apps-in-record-time&quot;&gt;Beautiful native apps in record time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Flutter allows you to build beautiful native apps on iOS and Android from a single codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Flutter&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019-01-10-Flutter/flutter_logo.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A promising statement which is presented to you when you browse to &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Flutter.io&lt;/a&gt;.
A statement that explains perfectly what Flutter is in fact.
Flutter is an open source mobile UI framework made by Google.
With Flutter, you can build beautiful apps that run at native speed.
Given the single codebase, you don’t have to develop the same app twice for both iOS and Android.
Flutter is even the first-class citizen for Fuchsia, an upcoming mobile OS that is currently being developed by Google.
Flutter apps follow platform conventions and interface details, so the scrolling, fonts, navigations, etc. will look natively respecting the specific platform.
All of this results in beautiful apps that require less time and resources to develop and this without compromising on quality, features, performance or design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left;&quot;&gt;Performance at its core&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Flutter&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019-01-10-Flutter/flutter-gallery.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did the Flutter team achieve all of this?
Why aren’t there any downgrades in performance while being a hybrid app?
The reason for this is that Flutter is built with performance in mind from the beginning.
In fact, being performant was the main reason why the Flutter team started with the framework.
Being hybrid was more of a side-effect because of the way the implementation is set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Flutter is so performant, you are guaranteed that Flutter apps will run at 60 FPS and more.
This leads to smooth animations and an instant responsive app which results in a great user experience.
Your app will also render perfectly on older devices, while even some native apps may have trouble to keep running at a constant refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this performance, Flutter does something different than other hybrid solutions.
The framework avoids having a JavaScript bridge between the app and the platform by using a language that compiles to native code.
This bridge is typically the bottleneck when it comes to performance in hybrid solutions.
The lack of the JavaScript bridge allows Flutter to communicate directly with the platform.
Which language are we talking about?
Well, all of this is made possible with Dart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dart-you-say&quot;&gt;‘Dart’ you say?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Dart&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019-01-10-Flutter/dart.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dartlang.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Dart&lt;/a&gt; is a programming language that was also developed by Google.
Its purpose is to build web, server and mobile apps.
You can develop your app with Dart, which will either be compiled to JavaScript or into native code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flutter team considered different languages, but many of them had drawbacks in one of the four dimensions for evaluation that they used.
Since Google had its own language ready to be used, the team also took a look at Dart.
Dart scored high on all the requirements and criteria that the team had predefined, which is why the decision was obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some huge benefits when using Dart compared to other languages.
One of them is the Dart runtime and compiler.
This enables Dart code to be compiled both AOT (Ahead Of Time) and JIT (Just In Time).
With AOT, Dart is compiled to native code which ensures that the execution is fast, high-performing and predictable.
Your app will start up faster and it will feel smoother while running it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JIT enables stateful hot-reloading, which gives developers an extremely fast development cycle.
Once you hit Save in your editor, the code changes are applied to your running app within a second without losing state.
This gives productivity an enormous boost and helps you to reach your goals faster than before.
No more refilling the same form to test some validation or navigating to a specific screen for you.
It is really impressive to see hot reload in action, especially when you’re used to the development cycle within native mobile development.
To me, it kind of feels like magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be asking yourself if it is worth learning a new language for a new framework.
From my experience, Dart is really easy to adopt, especially if you’re used to Java or JavaScript/TypeScript.
Dart feels natural to use and is a powerful language.
Most of the time when I’m playing around with Flutter I even don’t realize that I’m writing in another language.
In fact, it just &lt;del&gt;works&lt;/del&gt; writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;everything-is-a-widget&quot;&gt;Everything is a widget&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The native performance of Flutter apps is great, but how can you use Flutter to build your app?
The answer is widgets.
They are the building blocks that Flutter uses to build up your interface.
Widgets are responsible for the native look and feel that you want to create, so they are really important.
With widgets you’ll be able to create beautiful apps, exactly how your design team imagined them to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Widgets everywhere&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019-01-10-Flutter/meditation.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Flutter, everything is a widget!
Ranging from a button, an image, to the app itself.
Even the padding, positioning or navigation are all defined by the use of widgets.
You combine widgets to build up the interface to your liking.
Flutter will generate a widget tree out of it and uses that tree to render the layout on the screen of the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flutter uses its own set of widgets, which assures you have a pixel perfect layout on every device.
You’re not dependent, nor limited by the widgets provided by the platform.
The only thing that Flutter needs is a canvas to draw on.
You can compare Flutter with a game engine, or in this case rather an app engine.
By providing its own set of widgets, you can customize all of them to your liking.
This enables you to include your company branding through your app, ranging from colors to the shape of buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the widgets are written in Dart.
Because Flutter is an open source project, you can use the source code as a reference while applying the widgets.
With Flutter you don’t have to worry anymore about support libraries to render your apps on old devices or about OEMs that decide to alter the platform widgets because they can.
You can even enjoy the beauty of Material Design on devices that were released years before Material Design was introduced.
Your app will also be future proof, as new design implementations of platform widgets won’t affect or break the layout of your app.
&lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;JWorks widget&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019-01-10-Flutter/jworks_widget.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
If there are any breaking changes with future OS versions, then it’s a bug for Flutter to resolve instead for you.
Flutter even added notch-support for the iPhone X before the phone was released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can find a quick example how you can build up your layout by combining different widgets together.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;one-hybrid-framework-to-rule-them-all&quot;&gt;One hybrid framework to rule them all&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 4th of December 2018 the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/events/flutter-live/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Flutter Live&lt;/a&gt; event was hosted.
A lot of exciting announcements were made, which definitely shows that the Flutter team is determined to keep improving.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/12/flutter-10-googles-portable-ui-toolkit.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The first stable version was released&lt;/a&gt; almost two years after the first Alpha version was released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; alt=&quot;Hummingbird&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019-01-10-Flutter/hummingbird.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another huge announcement was revealed about the future plans of Flutter.
The first step is &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/flutter-io/hummingbird-building-flutter-for-the-web-e687c2a023a8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Hummingbird&lt;/a&gt;, or Flutter for the web.
Since Dart can also compile to JavaScript, this was a logical step to take.
Being able to run on the web, you can also create a Progressive Web App with Flutter, so your mobile app which runs in the browsers becomes a web app.
Appception right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is also working to bring Flutter to desktop with Flutter Desktop Embedding.
To prove this concept, the presentation of Flutter Live was running in a Flutter app on a laptop.
This means that Flutter won’t be a mobile SDK solely, but it might become the way to go SDK for hybrid apps across mobile, web and desktop.
Maybe later on, any device that can render pixels will be able to run Flutter apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Flutter team is working to provide integration between Flutter and your existing native apps.
Not everyone can start from scratch, so having a way to gradually move your app to Flutter is a very welcome addition if you’re planning to do so.
This project, which contains all the APIs and tooling, is named Add2App and is currently in a preview state.
With Add2App, you can launch a view containing your new Flutter app from your existing native app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also work in the opposite way with the introduction of Platform Views.
These views allow you to add native content inside your Flutter apps.
Platform Views unlocks Flutter to render Google Maps and WebViews inside the Flutter app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flutter keeps getting better and the community keeps on growing.
More and more &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/showcase&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; start to embrace Flutter
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://itsallwidgets.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;developers&lt;/a&gt; are excited and positive when using Flutter in their apps.
It surely looks promising that Flutter can become a big player in the mobile world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was getting in touch with Flutter and digging through the documentation and examples,
I got more and more fascinated about all the possibilities that you can achieve with this new mobile SDK.
The Flutter journey reminded me back of the feeling I had when I was working on my first mobile app,
discovering a new mobile world full of possibilities, this time built out of widgets.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;first_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Dimitri&quot;, &quot;last_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;De Kerf&quot;, &quot;permalink&quot;=&gt;&quot;/author/dimitri-de-kerf&quot;, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;&quot;dimitri-de-kerf.jpg&quot;, &quot;title&quot;=&gt;&quot;Frontend Developer&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;dimitri.de.kerf@ordina.be&quot;, &quot;github&quot;=&gt;&quot;DimiDeKerf&quot;, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Dimitri is a Frontend and Mobile developer at Ordina Belgium.

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://devoxx.ma/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Devoxx MA&lt;/a&gt; is a yearly conference in Morocco.
Previously it was held in Casablanca but for their 4th edition, xHub, 
the organisation behind Devoxx MA, decided to hold it in Marrakesh, in the lovely Palm Plaza Hotel on the 27th, 28th and 29th of November 2018.
Aside from the conference, the speakers were also offered an exclusive trip.
Four colleagues of Ordina JWorks: Yannick De Turck, Tim Ysewyn, Tom Van den Bulck and Maarten Casteels attended both the conference and the speakers trip.
Three of them were also featured as speaker.
In this blog post we share our impressions and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-speakers-dinner&quot;&gt;The Speakers dinner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening before the conference started, we had the speakers dinner sponsored by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lightbend.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lightbend&lt;/a&gt;.
The dinner was held at restaurant &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.restaurant-ksarelhamra.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Kasar El Hamra&lt;/a&gt; in the center of Marrakesh.
On our way to the center we got to experience the Moroccan traffic which seemed to be pretty chaotic with all the cars and motorcycles zipping around, evading each other on the streets.
Once arrived, we got treated with Moroccan dishes.
One after the other, each of them truly delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;p-image&quot; alt=&quot;Charles-Philippe Bernard&quot; src=&quot;/img/devoxx-ma-2018/speaker-charles-philippe.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles-Philippe explained why he loves &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;VueJS&lt;/a&gt; so much.
He criticised Angular and React because of the companies behind the frameworks, as well as the multiple variations of utilities and plugins. 
Instead, he prefers a community that stands as one behind the framework. 
Which is why he really likes VueJS as it is community-driven.
He explained that for each functionality, there is exactly one solution promoted by the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his session, Charles-Philippe went over several libraries that he often uses for animated websites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CSS3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://velocityjs.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Velocity.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Animate.css&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://animejs.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;anime.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Vanilla-tilt.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A convenient trick that we learned during the session is how to make a JPG transparent using CSS.
Note that this will only work if the image has a white background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-(css)&quot;&gt;img {
    mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mockk-the-idiomatic-mocking-framework-for-kotlin-by-yannick-de-turck&quot;&gt;MockK, the idiomatic mocking framework for Kotlin by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/YannickDeTurck&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Yannick De Turck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;p-image&quot; alt=&quot;Yannick De Turck&quot; src=&quot;/img/devoxx-ma-2018/speaker-yannick-de-turck.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our colleague, Yannick, gave a talk about MockK.
MockK is a mocking framework specifically made for Kotlin. 
As a Java developer, he is a huge fan of Mockito for using mocks in his unit tests.
When he picked up Kotlin, Mockito was also his first choice to try out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He explained however that using Mockito in a Kotlin project doesn’t go all that well due to how Mockito creates its mocks, which is by overriding classes and functions.
And because Kotlin’s classes and functions are final by default, you can see that this poses some challenges.
Yannick shared his experiences and mentioned that even though there is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/What%27s-new-in-Mockito-2#mock-the-unmockable-opt-in-mocking-of-final-classesmethods&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;incubating, opt-in feature&lt;/a&gt; to allow Mockito to mock final classes and functions, the user experience isn’t all that nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked for other frameworks and stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;https://mockk.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;MockK&lt;/a&gt;, a mocking framework created for Kotlin by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oleksiyp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Oleksiy Pylypenko&lt;/a&gt;.
MockK’s main philosophy is offering first-class support for Kotlin features and being able to write idiomatic Kotlin code when using it.
He was pretty enthusiastic about MockK and went over all its features and its ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a &lt;a href=&quot;/testing/2018/02/05/Writing-tests-in-Kotlin-with-MockK.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; written by Yannick specifically about his experiences with Mockito and MockK in Kotlin projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our colleagues, Tim Ysewyn and Tom Van den Bulck, gave a talk about stream processing live traffic data with Kafka Streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom presented the theoretical part of the talk starting with the bigger picture. 
He explained the stream processing concept which is basically computing data directly as it is produced or received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; src=&quot;/img/devoxx-ma-2018/01_data_at_rest_infrastructure.png&quot; alt=&quot;Data at rest infrastructure&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the image above we can see an example without stream processing.
In this case, the data is stored in databases and file storages.
Using a scheduler, applications can retrieve and process the stored data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; src=&quot;/img/devoxx-ma-2018/02_stream_processing_infrastructure.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stream processing infrastructure&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With stream processing the data will be processed directly as streams of events, creating other event streams for other applications if needed.
The applications will react on events instead of scheduling jobs to retrieve and process data stored in databases and file storages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following up the theoretical part, it was time for the demo.
Key part of the demo was of course the data that was going to get processed.
The Flemish government offers XML documents with live traffic data.
These documents are created every minute so by using a scheduled job, an event could be created out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theory behind all of this can be a bit abstract if you are not familiar with the concept which is why Tim first did some live coding to demonstrate how the events can be handled properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards we learned how Spring can be used to help us with Kafka and how we can periodically fetch the data.
We did this by first using pure code and secondly with the help of some convenient annotations to do the same thing with less code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the demo we created a small application that calculates the average speed for a specific sensor during a time frame of two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slides are available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/TimYsewyn/stream-processing-live-traffic-data-with-kafka-streams&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;SlideShare&lt;/a&gt;. 
The demo code can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Stream-Processing-with-Kafka-Streams/workshop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;p-image&quot; alt=&quot;Benjamin Nothdurft&quot; src=&quot;/img/devoxx-ma-2018/speaker-benjamin-nothdurft.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Benjamin started off by giving a brief introduction on Domain-Driven Design explaining the different building blocks such as domains, domain events, ubiquitous language and Event Storming.&lt;br /&gt;
He also mentioned the famous two books: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/domain-driven-design-tackling/0321125215/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Domain-Driven Design by Eric Evans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0321834577&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Implementing Domain-Driven Design by Vaugn Vernon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benjamin went through all the different steps of Event Storming.
The goal is to bring people of different silos together, such as developers, analysts, architects and business experts.
Together you want to create a logically ordered sequence of events to document a system using an ubiquitous language i.e. everybody using the same vocabulary and terms.
Events describe things that have happened and are thus always in the past tense e.g. product added to cart.
In a next step you want to identify commands, which are the triggers of events e.g. add product to cart.
There are also aggregates which represent the data that is interacted with.
And finally you want to identify the bounded contexts grouping relevant parts together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benjamin then explained how this all gets translated to your system architecture.
Each bounded context can be mapped to a single microservice.
He covered different context map patterns such as event publisher, shared kernel, customer/supplier and anti-corruption layer together with detailed code samples.
Afterwards he went through a CQRS example with many code samples and the questions you should be asking yourself when determining the right architecture.
We really liked how in-depth everything was as many presentations about Domain-Driven Design usually remain rather abstract and high-level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check out Benjamin’s slides on &lt;a href=&quot;https://slides.com/dataduke/2018-11-27-ddd#/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;slides.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Batch Processing: Map/Reduce and Apache Spark.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stream Processing: Apache Flink and Apache Kafka.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Machine Learning: Spark ML and Tensorflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her talk focused on the Hadoop setup of Criterio.
The current cluster in Paris has 220 PB of hard disk, 550 TB of memory and 100.000 cores.
But since it is almost “full”, with 160 PB used, a new cluster has been set up in Amsterdam.
Between both clusters there is a dedicated 400 Gbit fiber installed.
Every day, 1 PB of data is generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meriam currently works at a project in which they want to synchronise the data between both clusters.
This was not a trivial thing to do and the main question was how they were going to sync the data between both clusters, as copying over all data would fill the existing line for an entire day.
RSync was just too slow, also some jobs are non-deterministic which means that executing the job a second time will yield a different result compared to the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various options were considered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Double run: this means that the Paris data center would still become the bottleneck and would not yield real business value&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Producer push&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consumer push&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dedicated central service which will determine where the jobs will run, on which data center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dedicated central service was the chosen solution.
Codenamed “Mumak”, as it is the convention to name everything in the Hadoop ecosystem to an elephant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dataset by dataset will be progressively moved to Amsterdam, so that jobs will eventually be distributed between both data centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;la-keynote-de-la-nouvelle-generation-by-saskia-and-lois&quot;&gt;La keynote de la nouvelle generation by Saskia and Lois&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;p-image&quot; alt=&quot;Saskia and Lois&quot; src=&quot;/img/devoxx-ma-2018/speaker-saskia-lois.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
The closing keynote was presented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/saskialois&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Saskia&lt;/a&gt; (13) and Loïs (10) Blanc,
the children of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sebi2706&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sébastien Blanc&lt;/a&gt;. 
They started the closing keynote by asking the audience to close their eyes for a few seconds and to think about the near future and how we would imagine it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience had to explain what they were thinking of.
Most people shared the same things such as self-driving-cars and robots to help in the household. 
Saskia and Loïs in turn, shared their vision of the future which pretty much aligned with ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saskia started the first demo by giving an introduction on the Logo programming language while Loïs was doing some live coding.
A simple square was drawn first but it got more interesting as they added rotations to draw more complex figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loïs on the other hand explained Scratch, a program where you can create your own games, animations and interactive stories. 
He showed the community around the program and gave a really entertaining demo about two figures walking around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saskia explained us that she became more interested in what her dad was doing and that she wanted to get into more real programming.
Her father being a Java developer, told her about the Groovy programming language.
Saskia gave a demo in Groovy and explained some basics while live coding a small program.
The program consisted of an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; interface and a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cat&lt;/code&gt; class that could meow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saskia and Loïs ended their keynote mentioning that they both want to become developers of the new generation.
Given their impressive presentation, we definitely see that happening!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-speakers-trip-in-essaouira&quot;&gt;The Speakers Trip in Essaouira&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three interesting days of Devoxx MA, we went on the speakers trip to Essaouira, considered as one of the best anchorages of the Moroccan coast.
We started off by visiting &lt;a href=&quot;http://restaurant-chez-ali.com/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Chez Ali&lt;/a&gt; in Marrakesh on the last evening of the conference.
As we arrived we were heartily greeted by horsemen and Moroccans playing authentic music.
We got to explore Ali Baba’s cave before passing by all kinds of folkloric groups.
Dinner was served in big tents and consisted of multiple courses of Moroccan dishes.
After the dinner we got to watch an amazing spectacle of stuntmen on horses, belly dancers and cavaliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; src=&quot;/img/devoxx-ma-2018/chez-ali.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chez Ali&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The morning after, we set off to Essaouira with three buses filled of speakers and people part of the Devoxx MA organisation.
During the three-hour long ride we stopped by the magnificent “goat tree” and Arganomade, where they manufactured organic argan oil all by hand and where we got to see the whole manufacturing process.
In the early afternoon we arrived at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.essaouira-lodge.com/en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Essaouira Lodge&lt;/a&gt; where we would be staying during the trip.
After checking in and unpacking our luggage, we set off to the Essaouira beach where we had delicious sea food at restaurant Fanatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; src=&quot;/img/devoxx-ma-2018/essaouira-lodge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Essaouira Lodge&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our hunger satisfied, we set off with our buses a bit further along the beach where we got to ride camels in caravans.
With our newly allocated trusty steeds, we rode around the coast with the sun setting off in the background.
After a 30-minute ride in the sand we arrived at a big tent where we would spend the rest of the evening.
As dinner was being prepared in many tajines, we were entertained by live Moroccan music and dancers with a big cozy bonfire blazing about.
This was truly an amazing and memorable day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; src=&quot;/img/devoxx-ma-2018/camel-ride.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Camel Ride&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day after we went back to Essaouira beach and visited the fortress city with the walls still intact.
As we strolled through the alley streets we got to visit all kinds of shops and markets.
We had lunch on a roof terrace at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ilmaressaouira.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Il Mare&lt;/a&gt; with an amazing view on the sea.
Some more exploring was done around the city before we returned to our lodges.
We spent the rest of the evening in our lodges where we invited all speakers in our lodge for a nice last evening together with a couple of Casablanca beers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; src=&quot;/img/devoxx-ma-2018/essaouira-visit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Essaouira Visit&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we would not have been able to catch our flight back to Belgium in time, the four of us booked a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.nl/rooms/11040206&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;beautiful riad&lt;/a&gt; right in the center of Marrakesh.
We explored the Djemaa el Fna together with its back alleys and visited an authentic tannery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; src=&quot;/img/devoxx-ma-2018/riad-marrakesh.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Riad Marrakesh&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summing-it-all-up&quot;&gt;Summing it all up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devoxx MA was amazing experience for us where we got to meet and befriend a lot of great people.
We would like to thank the organisers for organising both Devoxx MA and offering us the chance to see more of Morocco with the speakers trip!
The date for next year’s edition has already been announced and will happen on the 12th, 13th and 14th of November 2019.

Previously it was held in Casablanca but for their 4th edition, xHub, the organisation behind Devoxx MA, decided to hold it in Marrakesh, in the lovely Palm Plaza Hotel on the 27th, 28th and 29th of November 2018. Aside from the conference, the speakers were also offered an exclusive trip. Four colleagues of Ordina JWorks: Yannick De Turck, Tim Ysewyn, Tom Van den Bulck and Maarten Casteels attended both the conference and the speakers trip. Three of them were also featured as speaker.

On the one hand, we see it all around us and try to cope with the complexity of it.
Attempting to avoid or even sabotage it in order to hang on for dear life, to what we have always known to be normal, and therefore believe it to be what’s best.
On the other hand, it’s what allows us to hope and strive, what drives us towards a dream for a better future.
And so we look for ways to form it, to mould it, even manipulate it at times, thinking that whatever comes out of the change will be better and lasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But does change have an outcome? 
Or is it endlessly moving forward? 
This continuous tension between coping and moulding makes our relationship with change a very personal one. 
Every day we strive, all of us, in this global community, to find a moment of peace with ourselves and with the ways we try to manage this uncertainty and complexity.
And sometimes, when the odds are right, in a cursory moment of clear thoughts, we discover that precious balance, and see the bigger picture. 
That’s when we embrace change and sense the opportunity…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When projecting this mechanism from the personal into the organisational area, the same elements are at play. 
But the personal aspect is still the crucial driver (and the key to unlock it), that can push corporate change forward or go against it like a stubborn forceful undercurrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tapping into that current, though, is the key to unlocking the potential of an engaged community of professionals, and so helping the organisational culture grow organically. 
And doing that needs a ‘feel’ for what our present corporate culture is about. 
But more so it requires an understanding of what the employees building our brand - and the people creating the customer value – really strive for, 
personally and professionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Surfer&quot; src=&quot;/img/catching-the-waves-of-servant-leadership/surfing.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; style=&quot;margin:0px auto; max-width: 750px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easier said than done, you think? 
Maybe so, especially when you’re working in a traditional corporate world, with siloed processes, with lots of gates and handovers, 
often distorting communication and slowing down value delivery. 
It does indeed call for a veritable paradigm shift, not just new management practices, but a management revolution; 
a shift towards a new approach, focused on what these value creators actually require in order to thrive in your organisation, for the benefit of your brand. 
Enabling them to become better, more inventive, more efficient, and allowing them to listen closely and collaborate with the customer, 
is the most successful way forward in our age of agile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is of course not a one (wo)man show. 
Complexity is not something we can tackle with a single mind solution. 
Agile transformation, like cultural transformation, can only be set in motion by natural leaders, and by this I don’t necessarily mean ‘managers’. 
They can be emergent leaders from any level in the organisation. 
People who spread vibes, generate positive energy, think beyond the borders of their own roles and put their brains to work to reimagine how value is created. 
What defines them is that they ‘service’ their community, and that service is exactly one of their personal goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Surfing&quot; src=&quot;/img/catching-the-waves-of-servant-leadership/surfing2.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; style=&quot;margin:0px auto; max-width: 750px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a manager, make sure these emergent leaders experience the freedom to act. 
Each one comes with a natural community, call it a ‘tribe’. 
Explore every nook and cranny of the company to trace them. 
Then help them to understand the agile strategy, and support them to instigate an agile mindset and a zest for growth, 
by taking small but consistent steps, clear and aligned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organisation will be surfing their powerful waves. 
And with the help of these servant leaders throughout the company, you’ll be able to blow the wind in the right direction, towards the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;power-of-svg-by-sara-soueidan&quot;&gt;‘Power of SVG’ by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sara Soueidan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some websites really have nice visuals that contribute to a pleasant user experience when visiting them. 
Think of brands that incorporate their logos in images for instance, or cover pictures that look like some Instagram filters were applied to them. 
You would think that such assets are created by designers and that they are applied directly to the webpage, but there is also a way to get those Photoshop effects straight into your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sara Soueidan showed us a few possibilities to apply some stunning visual effects on images and text with code. 
The cool thing is that when using plain text, it’s still searchable! 
First she discussed some techniques that designers use to create templates in Photoshop and afterwards she applied the same techniques by only using SVG. 
It was very impressive to see how you can manipulate images by applying a set of SVG filters. 
Hopefully using those SVG techniques will become more common in the future so that more visual appealing websites will be created with the power of SVG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading-hex-codes-by-david-desandro&quot;&gt;‘Reading Hex codes’ by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/desandro&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;David DeSandro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the most mind blowing talks of dotCSS by far.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/desandro&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;David DeSandro&lt;/a&gt; begins the talk with saying he has a special ability.
He can read color hex codes. 
At that moment the most of us were like &lt;em&gt;“What?”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“You can tell the color based on the hexcode?”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“Is that even possible?”&lt;/em&gt;
And well, he proved it to us that you really can tell the color based on the hex code.
He even showed us how to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so he told us that it requires 5 steps to read color hex codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3-digit shorthand&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Line graph&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hue from shape&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lightness from total&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Saturation from range&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like this I bet you have no idea what these steps mean.
But let us teach you the magic of reading color hex codes as well thanks to David.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started he taught us that the best way to describe colors is with the HSL color model.
HSL stands for Hue, Saturation and Lightness. 
Hue is the pure pigment of a color and can be described with 12 color names.
We’ll show you the color names later in Step 3.
Saturation is how vibrant or muted the hue is and can be described as &lt;em&gt;saturated&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;washed&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;muted&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;gray&lt;/em&gt;.
Lightness speaks for itself and describes how light or dark the color is and this can be done with &lt;em&gt;light&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;middle&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;dark&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know how you can describe a color all you have to do is to follow the 5 steps.
And deterimine the hue, lightness and saturation.
So let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-3-digit-shorthand&quot;&gt;Step 1: 3-digit shorthand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand the process let’s take &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#D49B25&lt;/code&gt; as an example.
The first step is to retrieve the 3-digit shorthand of the hexcode.
This can be done easily by breaking up the hexcode in 3 pairs (D4 | 9B | 25).
Keep in mind that each pair represents a value of the RGB color channel.
Now drop the second number of each pair and that gives us the shorthand code &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#D92&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; alt=&quot;Line graph of shorthand hex&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 50%&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018-11-08-dot-css-dot-js-2018/shorthand.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-line-graph&quot;&gt;Step 2: Line graph&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the shorthand from step one we have to create a linegraph based on the numbers of the hexcode.
With basic understanding of hexadecimal numbers we can visualize a little line graph for the channel values.
D is high, 9 is around the middle, 2 is low.
And that’s how we get our litle line graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; alt=&quot;Hex linegraph example&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 25%;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018-11-08-dot-css-dot-js-2018/hex-linegraph.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; alt=&quot;Line graph of shorthand hex for color #D92&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 25%;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018-11-08-dot-css-dot-js-2018/linegraph.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3-hue-from-shape&quot;&gt;Step 3: Hue from shape&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what we think is the most tricky part about reading color hex codes.
With the line graph we got from the previous step you’ll have to find a matching color on the color wheel.
So you’ll have to remember this one by heart if you really want to show off.
For our example color, it matches best with the color &lt;strong&gt;orange&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; alt=&quot;HSL color wheel with color names&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 75%&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018-11-08-dot-css-dot-js-2018/color-wheel.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4-lightness-from-total&quot;&gt;Step 4: Lightness from total&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the lightness you should look either at the total sum of the channel values (pairs) or at the values in the line graph we created.
If the values are higher to the top, the color is closer to white and thus lighter.
If the values are closer to the bottom, the color is closer to black and thus darker.
For our example color &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#D92&lt;/code&gt;, the values are both high and low, so it has &lt;strong&gt;middle&lt;/strong&gt; lightness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; alt=&quot;Determining lightness of a color&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 50%&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018-11-08-dot-css-dot-js-2018/lightness.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-5-saturation&quot;&gt;Step 5: Saturation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturation is a measure of how vibrant or rich the hue/color is.
To measure the saturation whe need to look at the difference between the highest and the lowest value in our shorthand code.
The wider the range, the higher the saturation. 
Colors with small range have low saturation, appearing faded.
A color with no saturation is a pure gray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; alt=&quot;Measuring and describing saturation of a color&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 50%&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018-11-08-dot-css-dot-js-2018/saturation.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our color, #D92, D is the highest value, 2 is the lowest.
D is high. 2 is low.
That’s a wide range, but not completely wide.
So our color has moderate saturation, thus making it a &lt;strong&gt;washed&lt;/strong&gt; color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have all three attributes for our color
So we can say &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#D49B25&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;Middle Washed Orange&lt;/strong&gt;.
Pretty amazing right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; alt=&quot;#D49B25 color described as Middle Washed Orange&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 50%&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018-11-08-dot-css-dot-js-2018/final-color.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since dotCss puts most of its talks online we definitely recommend watching this talk.
He just explains it so well and goes a little bit deeper than we did here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variable font is an OpenType font format that includes new technology called OpenType Font Variations. 
Jointly developed by four of the most influential technology companies — Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Adobe — these font files contain a huge amount of extra data, compared to your average OpenType font. 
A variable font can contain a font’s entire glyph set, or individual glyphs with up to 64,000 axes of variation, including weight, width, slant, and, in some cases, specific styles, such as Condensed, Bold, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main advantages when using variable fonts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The average file size is smaller than separate font files&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only one request is necessary to load the necessary font variations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example is the font &lt;a href=&quot;https://v-fonts.com/fonts/source-sans-variable&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Source Sans Variable&lt;/a&gt; or the font &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typenetwork.com/brochure/decovar-a-decorative-variable-font-by-david-berlow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Decovar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also showed us the possibilities of variable fonts and what kind of awesome stuff you can do with them.&lt;br /&gt;
Did you know that you can make text animations with them?&lt;br /&gt;
Well you can, so check it out on her &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/collection/XqRLMb/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;codepen.io collection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can easily check for browser support using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@supports&lt;/code&gt; CSS rule: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@supports (font-variation-settings)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan talked about all the things he learned in his lifelong journey of working with CSS.
But in the end it all came down to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have side projects to keep your skills sharp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s OK not to use the latest and greatest in business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;breaking-the-norm-with-creative-css-by-aga-naplocha&quot;&gt;‘Breaking the norm with creative CSS’ by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aganaplocha&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Aga Naplocha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last presentation of the dotCSS conference was about using other inspirations and tools to build webpages. 
Aga made a bold remark that most of the websites out there have the same structure and even look and feel the same. 
As a big fan of Brutalist Design she showed &lt;a href=&quot;http://brutalistwebsites.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;some examples&lt;/a&gt; to demonstrate what is possible when you think out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With her talk she wanted to encourage developers to try and use other CSS Properties for building and designing websites. 
The three CSS properties she mentioned were clipping, masking and shape-outside (all in combination with SVG — using masking with images is resource intensive since it operates pixel per pixel). 
She showed each property with a clear example and discussed the differences between them, and mentioned the compatibility of each property in the different browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying that most of the websites have the same look and feel is a bold statement but after you look around for a while you notice that she actually has a point. 
Most of the websites are using frameworks that give you a uniform, recognizable look and feel but are also really easy to use. 
With the properties she mentioned you can certainly build a beautiful, well-designed website but it would take more time to make sure you have a responsive website that has the same look and feel over the different browsers and devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;day-2-dotjs&quot;&gt;Day 2: dotJS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-state-of-js-by-sacha-greif&quot;&gt;‘The State of JS’ by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sachagreif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sacha Greif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we all know, the JavaScript ecosystem is richer than ever, and even the most experienced developers become victims of the amount of choices they have to make.
It’s always changing. New libraries, frameworks, languagues…
For this reason Sacha Greif, Raphaël Benitte and Michael Rambeau decided to create a global survey they called the ‘State of JavaScript’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey contains data from over 20.000 developers from all around the globe and you can find the results on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://stateofjs.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.
The survey tries to figure out what these developers are using these days, what they like and what they would love to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they published the State of JS results of 2018 there was a lot of commotion regarding the results.
More specifically regarding the front end frameworks Angular, React and Vue.
The State of JS survey declares that Angular is suffering a lot in comparison with React and Vue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image fit&quot; alt=&quot;#D49B25 color described as Middle Washed Orange&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018-11-08-dot-css-dot-js-2018/stateofjs-fe-results.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Angular results are very disappointing and show us a high rate of dissatisfaction within its userbase.
On the other side there is only love for both React and Vue.
This lead to a war on Twitter and other channels saying the survey is flawed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olivier Combe who is a member of the core team &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OCombe/status/1064918179321913344&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;called out to Sasha&lt;/a&gt; why they didn’t make the distinction between AngularJS and Angular.
It makes total sense a lot of people are using Angular (read v2+) now and are not using AngularJS any longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There even is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnEPBQvkNrg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;YouTube Video&lt;/a&gt; that takes a closer look at the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, we believe this survey can help lots of developers make choices and it gives at least some insights on the State of JavaScript.
Besides the front end frameworks, the State of JS also offers lots of data of other subjects regarding JavaScript which are definitely worth checking out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;minecraft-is-getting-a-javascript-runtime-by-tobias-ahlin&quot;&gt;‘Minecraft is getting a JavaScript runtime’ by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tobiasahlin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tobias Ahlin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tobias blew our mind with the message that Minecraft has a HTML based UI that is using a JavaScript runtime.
Just think about it: a JavaScript runtime running on top of your games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JS runtime provides access to UI elements and an API to give developers enough freedom to work with the interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worth mentioning is that this is completely mobile optimized and is based on flexbox.
Using floats is just too expensive on processing power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-to-love-type-systems-by-lauren-tan&quot;&gt;‘Learning to Love Type Systems’ by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sugarpirate_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lauren Tan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the introduction of TypeScript in 2012, web development has consistently looked more towards building software with the use of static typing. 
Lauren discussed why we should embrace the use of optional static typing that TypeScript provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using types, we add more constraints to our code and how other developers can use our code. 
Thus this decreases the amount of possible bugs during the development phases of a project. 
According to Lauren, types are mathematical propositions on how a program should work and the written code that complies to the types is a proof of the type system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren explained that while using types we should be as strict as possible. 
The lower cardinality we have in our types, the less bugs will occur as we limit the possible inputs to our functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With TypeScript it’s convenient to use a type such as &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; but we’re better off avoiding using the &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; type. 
By consistently being as strict as possible in our type usage, we facilitate better integration between different developers and teams. 
It is definitely true that stricter typing helps with defining the limits of your code while also documenting your code indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;choosing-your-javascript-framework-by-john-papa&quot;&gt;‘Choosing Your JavaScript Framework’ by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/john_papa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;John Papa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the current JavaScript frameworks out there it’s hard to pick one to work with. 
During his talk John Papa took a closer look to the three most popular frameworks at the moment: Angular, React and Vue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When choosing the framework for your project you could ask yourself questions like &lt;em&gt;“Does it have all the features that I need?”&lt;/em&gt;, 
&lt;em&gt;“What about the documentation?”&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;“Is it backed by a strong community?”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“How fast is the framework?”&lt;/em&gt;.
In this case all three frameworks would apply. 
But they all have a different way to work with components, lazy loading, state management and other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;
Take for example the language it’s written in. 
With Angular comes TypeScript, but React and Vue are by default JavaScript. 
Do you fancy TypeScript but you don’t like to work with Angular? 
No issue, you can perfectly use TypeScript in React and Vue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are all perfect for building successful applications and you can go on for hours on which one is the best.
But in the end it comes down to one question: &lt;em&gt;“How does the framework make you feel when you use it?”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
The only way to find out is by &lt;strong&gt;trying each one&lt;/strong&gt;. 
That’s why John Papa created a Tour of Heroes project for each framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jpapa.me/hero-angular&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tour of Heroes with Angular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you wanna know which one he prefers? 
Well, he did not want to reveal that during the talk…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;javascript-on-the-desktop-fast-and-slow-by-felix-rieseberg&quot;&gt;‘JavaScript on the Desktop, Fast and Slow’ by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/felixrieseberg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Felix Rieseberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javascript is everywhere today, even in desktop applications e.g. Battlefield 1, Nvidia GeForce Experience and Adobe Creative Suite. 
Felix reveals his four tricks that can make your application more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before importing a specific module, really consider if you need all of its functionalities as it might bring in some additional items that you don’t need. 
When you do require a specific module, make sure you embed it at the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using Node.js - which uses the V8 Javascript engine - the engine runs every time you build and compiles your code into something your machine can execute. 
You can easily cache this with the module &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v8-compile-cache&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repainting the screen is an expensive operation. 
You can check with Chrome Developer Tools how much this operation costs and maybe tweak some code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His third trick is that not all code is equal. 
Sometimes there is a more efficient way to structure your code or use different function calls with the same end result that could make your application faster. 
Using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getElementByClassName&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/code&gt; for example would be 99% faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to close off, application lifecycle.
If your application is minimized, pause the network requests and stop refreshing every couple of seconds. 
You can check this with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;document.hidden&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had an interesting two days at dotCSS and dotJS, and had a lot of fun engaging with the wonderful people at the conference.
One thing we noticed is that the talks at dotCSS were way more technical than the ones given at dotJS and somehow that made us feel a little bit disappointed.
Nonetheless we learned a lot of things and had a great time visiting the city of love.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;first_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Jan&quot;, &quot;last_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;De Wilde&quot;, &quot;github&quot;=&gt;&quot;MrJean&quot;, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;&quot;Mr_Jean&quot;, &quot;linkedin&quot;=&gt;&quot;jandewilde&quot;, &quot;permalink&quot;=&gt;&quot;/author/jan-de-wilde/&quot;, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;&quot;jan-de-wilde.jpg&quot;, &quot;title&quot;=&gt;&quot;Practice Lead Frontend&quot;, &quot;title2&quot;=&gt;&quot;Senior Frontend Developer&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;jan.dewilde@ordina.be&quot;, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Jan De Wilde is a Senior Frontend Developer at Ordina Belgium, focussed on building quality mobile/hybrid applications that are accessible on a big collection of devices.

&lt;p&gt;We, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ordina.be/vakgebieden/bi-analytics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;VisionWorks&lt;/a&gt;, were asked to rebuild the visualisation dashboard &lt;a href=&quot;https://ordina-jworks.github.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;JWorks&lt;/a&gt; used in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stairwayto.health/dashboard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;application&lt;/a&gt; they built as a result of the internal Stairway to Health project (you can find more information about that project &lt;a href=&quot;https://ordina-jworks.github.io/iot/2018/03/14/Stairway-To-Health-2.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). 
We decided to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tableau.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tableau&lt;/a&gt;, a popular BI Visualisation tool we largely use at our clients.
We developed the dashboard working around some key questions while keeping the appearance of the dashboard in line with the dashboard JWorks developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following section we will explain how the dashboard is currently set up and how to use it properly.
Next, we will go over the features we can add in future releases to allow the user to go even deeper in their analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;dashboard-overview&quot;&gt;Dashboard overview&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dashboard is built to answer &lt;strong&gt;the following questions&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the percentage of people taking the stairs or elevator at Ordina &lt;strong&gt;today&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How is the same metric on weekly, monthly or yearly basis? What is it in absolute numbers?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How does it evolve over time based on each day, week, month or year?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are people taking the stairs more this week compared to last week?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dashboard will try to provide answers to these questions using the following &lt;strong&gt;three main parts&lt;/strong&gt;.
We will go over these parts and highlight which question(s) they try to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-one-the-title&quot;&gt;Part one: the Title&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title is what the user sees first and answers the first question.
By using the colors in the title, the dashboard shows the user - in a subtle way - what the colors in the next visuals represent.
There is also an option to select another day as illustrated below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2018-11-16-stairway-to-health/PartOne.gif&quot; alt=&quot;PartOne&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-two-the-horizontal-bar-comparison&quot;&gt;Part two: the horizontal bar comparison&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part two the user can find an answer to questions two and three.
The visual uses the selected day to show the division between people taking the stairs / elevator on a daily / weekly / monthly and yearly basis.
When the user hovers over the chart he can also see the evolution of people taking the stairs / elevator within that day / week / month / year.
Next to the chart, the total absolute number of all the observations measured is reported per period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2018-11-16-stairway-to-health/PartTwo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;PartTwo&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-three-the-more-detailed-area-chart&quot;&gt;Part three: the more detailed area chart&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third part visualises how the division stairs / elevator is evolving over time expressed in daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis.
This gives the user the possibility to look at trends and to see how the situation of today compares itself to past situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the title the user has the option to change the appearance of the data (absolute or shares).
The amount of periods shown (starting from the most recent period) can also be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2018-11-16-stairway-to-health/PartThreeOne.gif&quot; alt=&quot;PartThreeOne&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the user hovers over the chart the same horizontal bar comparison can be seen. 
Comparisons can be made with the period selected above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2018-11-16-stairway-to-health/PartThreeTwo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;PartThreeTwo&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last feature to discuss here is how the user can change which period the chart is showing.
This can be done by clicking the chart above.
When you click on the day bar on the top chart the bottom chart is expressed on a day level.
This also applies to the other period bases in the chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2018-11-16-stairway-to-health/PartThreeThree.gif&quot; alt=&quot;PartThreeThree&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-can-we-do-next&quot;&gt;What can we do next?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this dashboard already gives an answer to the most important questions and gives the user the possibility to explore the data over time, there are still some extra things that can be developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dashboard is currently built within a Tableau workbook which is using the data of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; database JWorks set up as an extract.
This means we don’t have a live connection to the actual database JWorks has in their app.
This brings us to the first thing we can still explore: &lt;strong&gt;deployment&lt;/strong&gt;.
In order to integrate the dashboard in the original application, we could publish the dashboard on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tableau.com/trial/tableau-server&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tableau server&lt;/a&gt; of Ordina which is running on &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Microsoft Azure&lt;/a&gt;.
Running this instance is not free so when taking a decision we should also take the user relevance in consideration: does the user really need to have a live connection to the data or does a nightly update cover the load?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly we can still do a lot on the &lt;strong&gt;analysis part&lt;/strong&gt;. What are the reasons why some patterns in the data exist? Do people take the stairs less when it is hot outside?
JWorks recently tracked on which floor the observation is measured, allowing us to look into difference by floor. Do people take the elevator more when they need to go from floor 1 to floor 3?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will keep you posted on further progress related to Stairway to Health. Thank you for reading and don’t forget: always take the stairs!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;first_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Gert-Jan&quot;, &quot;last_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Schokkaert&quot;, &quot;linkedin&quot;=&gt;&quot;gert-jan-schokkaert-b87961b4&quot;, &quot;permalink&quot;=&gt;&quot;/author/gert-jan-schokkaert/&quot;, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;&quot;gert-jan-schokkaert.jpg&quot;, &quot;title&quot;=&gt;&quot;Data Visualisation Consultant&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;gert-jan.schokkaert@ordina.be&quot;, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Gert-Jan Schokkaert works as a Data Visualisation Consultant at Ordina Belgium.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To end the year on a lighter more inspirational note we’ll go into 10 cool examples achieved with artificial intelligence.
These are all short videos with some additional information, most of these already have or will soon have an impact on our lives one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10 examples can be divided in to three categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-the-models-work-and-perceive-the-world&quot;&gt;How the models work and perceive the world&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, there is still no need to fear Skynet becoming a reality.
While progress in the artificial intelligence world proceeds at a staggering pace, we are no where near having a general ‘super’ AI.
This however does not mean precautions do not need to be taken to prevent this from happening in the long run.
Some people, like Elon Musk, are very vocal about this and question if we should even pursue the goal to create a ‘super’ AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;stack&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018-12-10-AI10EX/intro.png&quot; class=&quot;image fit&quot; style=&quot;margin:0px auto; max-width: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;10-cool-examples&quot;&gt;10 Cool examples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the ten selected examples we think you should see!
In the resources section underneath all of them you can find more useful resources to use and watch about AI/ML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-1---how-neural-networks-see-the-world&quot;&gt;Example 1 - How neural networks see the world&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;responsive-video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;1164&quot; height=&quot;655&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1zvohULpe_0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding a neural network is difficult, we don’t actually know what is happening inside of it.
We need ways of visualizing and understanding what happens inside to help debug and improve these networks.
For convolutional neural networks this helps us see what the network sees and how it identifies and uses parts of the input to get to the desired output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-2---attack-on-human-vision-system&quot;&gt;Example 2 - Attack on human vision system&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;responsive-video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;1164&quot; height=&quot;655&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/AbxPbfODGcs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only artificial neural networks are vulnerable to attacks to fool them.
Our very own brain, a neural network as well, is also able to be tricked by some of these techniques.
This video shows how such an attack works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;responsive-video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;1164&quot; height=&quot;655&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SA4YEAWVpbk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video shows how neural networks can be fooled by changes to the input as small as a single pixel!
It shows that caution needs to be taken in neural network based image recognition because a sufficiently witty/crafty attacker could fool the system by employing such an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-3---style-transfer-for-videos&quot;&gt;Example 3 - Style transfer for videos&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;responsive-video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;1164&quot; height=&quot;655&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uxax5EKg0zA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Style transfer is when the style of a given input image is transferred to a secondary input image while maintaining the content of that image but with the style of the first input.
This gives you the option to apply the style of certain great works of art to regular images or even works with a totally different style.
In this video the technique is applied to video content, but it is not just as simple as running the earlier technique on each frame of the video since it does not provide a result that is temporally coherent.
The video is styled based on a given input and produces quite amazing results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-4---amazing-night-time-photographs&quot;&gt;Example 4 - Amazing night time photographs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;responsive-video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;1164&quot; height=&quot;655&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bcZFQ3f26pA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very noisy night time images might soon be a thing of the past.
The technique in this video can turn unusably noisy photos into perfectly viewable photos.
Something like this has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18021944/google-night-sight-pixel-3-camera-samples&quot;&gt;implemented in the google pixel phones&lt;/a&gt; recently.
In a few years all cameras will have a mode like this implemented making unusable night shots a thing of the past!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-5---nvidia-ai-based-image-restoration&quot;&gt;Example 5 - Nvidia AI based image restoration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;responsive-video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;1164&quot; height=&quot;655&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/P0fMwA3X5KI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the example above this is about denoising and is similar yet different.
This AI has been trained without ever having been shown what noise is, so no before vs after comparison.
It can remove noise from images, restore images that are almost only visible noise and even remove lots of text from a given image.
This technique will make cleaning up images much easier and allow us to preserve and restore imagery that might otherwise be lost or unusable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-6---noise-reduction-for-path-traced-gi&quot;&gt;Example 6 - Noise reduction for path traced GI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;responsive-video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;1164&quot; height=&quot;655&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HSmm_vEVs10&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video shows that denoising techniques can have other great benefits in the visual/gaming industry.
Path traced global illumination (casting light in a 3D scene to determine lighting from a global source like the sun) is a very resource intensive task.
Current solutions use all sorts of tricks to mimic this but they are not the real deal.
This technique allows for path traced GI with a very low sample count and denoises the output whilst being temporally stable.
Something like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms7d-3Dprio&quot;&gt;new cards from Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; are now capable of!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-7---isolate-speech-signals&quot;&gt;Example 7 - Isolate speech signals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;responsive-video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;1164&quot; height=&quot;655&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zL6ltnSKf9k&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having an audio or video file with multiple people speaking at once or when there is a lot of background noise can be annoying for various reasons.
It makes it harder to understand any of the speaking parties.
This technique allows each speaker’s audio to be isolated and listened to without hearing the other sources of interference.
It is helpful to clean up conversations or remove background noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-8---impersonate-anyone&quot;&gt;Example 8 - Impersonate anyone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;responsive-video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;1164&quot; height=&quot;655&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EQX1wsL2TSs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon you will not be able to tell that what you see is actually what happened.
This advanced technique improves on older versions, and allows you to transfer your facial and torso movements onto a target.
Techniques like this make it clear that fake news and fake sources of media will become an even bigger problem in the future as this technology becomes even better.
It might not be such a bad idea to invest in that blockchain backed media repository after all so the validity of media files can be tracked…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-9---deepmind-becomes-superhuman-in-quake-3&quot;&gt;Example 9 - Deepmind becomes superhuman in quake 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;responsive-video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;1164&quot; height=&quot;655&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MvFABFWPBrw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In games you normally play against the AI.
These AI’s are mostly cheaters though, they know more because they are fed insider information from the game itself.
The AI’s in this video are actual players that only get the video output of the game and learn to play accordingly.
This in the long run will allow games to have decent real AI in-game.
Other sectors can also benefit from this as it can be applied to different fields where complex behavior with tactics and long term planning is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-10---using-games-for-deep-learning-research&quot;&gt;Example 10 - Using games for deep learning research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;responsive-video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;1164&quot; height=&quot;655&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QkqNzrsaxYc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self driving cars are all the rage these days.
Getting cars to drive themselves is an immensely complex task, requiring truly vast amounts of correctly classified data in a dataset.
Classifying this data is a very time consuming process.
This technique can use games like GTAV to create a dataset with imagery from the game.
The game already knows what all the types of objects are in the scene, so classification can be simplified and automated.
It also provides an easy way to simulate hard to recreate situations in real life.
Time of day and scene composition can be easily changed which results in a vastly more extensive dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very good video to watch is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9OHn5ZF4Uo&quot;&gt;How machines learn&lt;/a&gt; by CGP Gray.
It generally explains how machine learning works and what some of the implied dangers are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the videos used in this blogpost are from the the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/keeroyz/videos&quot;&gt;Two minute papers&lt;/a&gt; YouTube channel.
This channel has short videos that showcase some scientific research in a visual and compelling way whilst not going too technical but still providing all the technical resources for those who want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&amp;amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&quot;&gt;playlist about neural networks&lt;/a&gt; by 3Blue1Brown.
It goes into how neural networks work and is very visual which helps greatly with understanding the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
