## Introduction

In an era where data breaches and cyberattacks dominate headlines, traditional password-based authentication methods increasingly fail to provide the security and convenience that today's dynamic, multi-cloud environments demand. Enter SPIFFE, the Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone, a revolutionary solution that not only addresses the shortcomings of passwords but also unlocks a new era of identity management in complex, distributed systems.

As businesses expand their operations across multiple cloud platforms, maintaining consistent and robust authentication mechanisms becomes all the more daunting. The complexities of managing access across various clouds, services, and applications while safeguarding sensitive data demand a paradigm shift. This is where going "passwordless" emerges as a beacon of innovation, promising enhanced security, streamlined user experiences, and simplified administration.

This blog post will explain how to install SPIFFE on your on-premises Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, we will deploy an application that will establish a connection with an S3 bucket.


## Install Cert-manager

Installing [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} on your Kubernetes cluster before installing SPIFFE is a crucial step. Cert-manager is a widely used tool that automates the management of TLS certificates within Kubernetes.

Integrating SPIFFE into your Kubernetes cluster relies on secure communication channels established through TLS certificates. Cert-manager simplifies the management and issuance of these certificates, ensuring that the identities and connections established by SPIFFE are trustworthy and adequately encrypted.


### Create a namespace for cert-manager

We begin by creating a namespace where we will deploy cert-manager and SPIFFE.<br>
Use the following two commands to create the namespaces and switch to the desired namespace:

```bash
kubectl create namespace cert-manager
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=cert-manager
```

### Add jetstack

In order to install Cert-manager and SPIFFE, we can make use of the Helm package manager and install these Helm charts on our cluster. To achieve this, we need to fetch the Jetstack repository locally.<br>
Use the following commands to achieve this:

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update
```

### Install cert manager

Now that we've added Jetstack as a helm repository, we can proceed to install Cert Manager on our Kubernetes cluster.<br>
Use the following commands to install Cert Manager:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.11.0/cert-manager.crds.yaml
helm upgrade --install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --version v1.11.0 --set prometheus.enabled=false
```


## Install SPIFFE

### Install SPIFFE

Now that Cert Manager is installed, we can proceed to the installation of SPIFFE.<br>
To do this, use the following command:

<i>Please note: for the trusted domain, you could use a different name; I suggest using the name of your Kubernetes cluster. You will need this domain name later when setting up AWS policies.</i>

```bash
helm upgrade --install cert-manager-csi-driver-spiffe jetstack/cert-manager-csi-driver-spiffe --wait \
--set image.tag=aws \
--set image.repository.driver=ghcr.io/joshvanl/cert-manager-csi-driver \
--set image.repository.approver=ghcr.io/joshvanl/cert-manager-csi-driver-approver \
--set "app.logLevel=1" \
--set "app.trustDomain=demo.home.cluster" \
--set "app.approver.signerName=clusterissuers.cert-manager.io/csi-driver-spiffe-ca" \
--set "app.issuer.name=csi-driver-spiffe-ca" \
--set "app.issuer.kind=ClusterIssuer" \
--set "app.issuer.group=cert-manager.io"
```


### Configure SPIFFE

To obtain and renew certificates automatically, we use the following ClusterIssuer.<br>
Deploy it using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicholasM95/spiffe-demo/main/setup/clusterissuer.yaml
```

### Verify installation

Verify if all pods have started and check whether the secret `csi-driver-spiffe-ca` has been created.

## Configure AWS
### Create the s3 bucket

Create a S3 bucket with a relevant and easy name and upload a text file named 'hello.txt'. Our application will read this file later.

<img src="{{ '/img/2023-08-30-spiffe/spiffe-2.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Create S3 bucket" class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto; max-width:100%">

### Create a trusted anchor
In the context of AWS, a trusted anchor might involve setting up a trust relationship with an external identity provider or certificate authority. This ensures that the SPIFFE identities generated within the Kubernetes cluster can be verified and trusted by AWS services when defining policies, access controls, or other security-related configurations.


To achieve this, we need a CA certificate that is utilized by SPIFFE on our Kubernetes cluster. Use the following command to obtain the CA certificate:

```bash
kubectl get secret csi-driver-spiffe-ca -o jsonpath='{.data}'
```

Copy the value of ca.crt and decode it using base64.
Example: 

```bash
echo 'copied-value' | base64 -d
```

Navigate to the IAM section within AWS and access the "Roles" tab.
Scroll down and choose "Roles Anywhere."
Ensure that you are still within the desired region.
Generate a trust anchor.
Opt for the external certificate bundle option.
Paste the decoded value of `ca.crt` from the secret.

### Create a trusted profile

A trusted profile establishes trust, defines access controls, and enables secure interaction between SPIFFE-issued identities within a Kubernetes cluster and AWS resources. It ensures a smooth and secure integration between these two environments while maintaining a solid security posture.

We require a policy that allows our application, operating in the 'spiffe' namespace with service account 'file-read-app', to gain read access to files within our designated bucket, all within the 'demo.home.cluster' cluster.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
	  "Statement": [
		    {
			      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
			      "Condition": {
				        "StringLike": {
					          "aws:PrincipalTag/x509SAN/URI": "spiffe://demo.home.cluster/ns/spiffe/sa/file-read-app"
				        }
			      },
			      "Effect": "Allow",
			      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::demospiffe/*",
			      "Sid": ""
		    }
	  ]
}
```

Create a new role, establish a trust relationship, and append the previously mentioned policy to the permission policy.<br>
Don't forget to change the Arn source to your trust anchor.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "rolesanywhere.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": [
                "sts:TagSession",
                "sts:SetSourceIdentity",
                "sts:AssumeRole"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {
                    "aws:PrincipalTag/x509SAN/URI": "spiffe://demo.home.cluster/ns/*/sa/*"
                },
                "ArnEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:rolesanywhere:eu-west-1:930970667460:trust-anchor/6eac6a56-97c3-439f-9074-f33c576ab08d"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Go back to the "Roles Anywhere" page and create a new trust profile, again check your region.
Use the role you created before.

## Deploy application

### Create a namespace for our application

We begin by creating a namespace where we will deploy our application. <br> 
Use the following two commands to create the namespaces and switch to the desired namespace:

```bash
kubectl create namespace spiffe
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=spiffe
```

### Deploy service account

We require a service account named 'file-read-app' for our application.
Create a new file named 'serviceaccount.yaml' with the following content.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: file-read-app
```

Deploy service account.

```bash
kubectl apply -f serviceaccount.yaml
```


### Deploy role

We require a role named 'file-read-app' for our application.
Create a new file named 'role.yaml' with the following content.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: file-read-app
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["cert-manager.io"]
    resources: ["certificaterequests"]
    verbs: ["create"]
```

Deploy role.

```bash
kubectl apply -f role.yaml
```

### Deploy role binding

We require a role binding named 'file-read-app' for our application.
Create a new file named 'rolebinding.yaml' with the following content.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: file-read-app
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: file-read-app
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: file-read-app
```

Deploy role binding.

```bash
kubectl apply -f rolebinding.yaml
```

### Deploy application

Create a new file named 'deployment.yaml' with the following content.
If necessary, update the environment variables.
Fill in the three AWS resources with the one you have generated.

SPIFFE will mount files in the volume we created here, SPIFFE would create a certificate to communicate with AWS. 
After the certificate is generated, SPIFFE will use this to retrieve AWS credentials and mount them.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: demo-spiffe
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: demospiffe
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: demospiffe
    spec:
      serviceAccount: file-read-app
      containers:
        - name: demospiffe
          image: nicholas95/spiffedemo:dev-1
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          env:
            - name: AWS_REGION
              value: eu-west-1
            - name: AWS_BUCKET
              value: demospiffe
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /root/.aws
              name: spiffe
      volumes:
        - csi:
            driver: spiffe.csi.cert-manager.io
            readOnly: true
            volumeAttributes:
              aws.spiffe.csi.cert-manager.io/enable: "true"
              aws.spiffe.csi.cert-manager.io/role: arn:aws:iam::930970667460:role/nicholas_meyers_home_k8s_read
              aws.spiffe.csi.cert-manager.io/trust-anchor: arn:aws:rolesanywhere:eu-west-1:930970667460:trust-anchor/1bf58d4e-35c6-465c-a05c-1bdcce05054b
              aws.spiffe.csi.cert-manager.io/trust-profile: arn:aws:rolesanywhere:eu-west-1:930970667460:profile/fa6c37f9-f64a-4bdf-b0f6-c39ec5282aa4
          name: spiffe
```

Deploy application.

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
### Test our application

When your pod is started, you can open a shell into it using the following command and install curl. 
Once curl is installed, you can send a GET request to '/file/hello.txt', the response will be the content of the file in the S3 bucket.

```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh
apk add curl
curl http://localhost:8080/file/hello.txt
exit
```

We've also included a file watcher to monitor the renewal of credentials and certificates.

## Conclusion

By setting up our connection with S3 in this manner, we eliminate the need to manage access keys and secret keys ourselves. As a result, the likelihood of our keys being leaked is minimized. Additionally, both our certificates and AWS credentials have a short lifespan.

Furthermore, we are relieved from the task of key rotation as this process occurs automatically.
