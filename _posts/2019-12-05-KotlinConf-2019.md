## Opening keynote by [Hadi Hariri](https://twitter.com/hhariri){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Andrey Breslav](https://twitter.com/abreslav){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
### Introduction
<span class="image right"><img class="p-image" style="max-width: 200px" alt="Hadi Hariri" src="/img/kotlinconf-2019/hadi-hariri.jpg"></span>
Hadi kicked off the keynote by saying that this year is the third time that KotlinConf has sold out once again with over 1.700 participants.

A [free live stream](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2019/11/kotlinconf-2019-live-join-the-broadcast-attend-the-qa){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} of all the different rooms would be made available for anyone to attend.
Some additional numbers were given such as that the conference counted over 60 speakers, 35 volunteers, and that there were people visiting the conference from over 86 countries.
During the evening there was also going to be the special new product announcement of JetBrains, just before the evening party.

Hadi then introduced Andrey Breslav, CTO and Lead Language Designer of Kotlin.

<img class="image fit" src="{{ '/img/kotlinconf-2019/keynote-1-intro-andrey-breslav.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Intro Andrey Breslav" />

### Evolution of Kotlin
<span class="image right"><img class="p-image" style="max-width: 200px" alt="Andrey Breslav" src="/img/kotlinconf-2019/andrey-breslav.jpg"></span>
Andrey continued with some numbers on the usage of Kotlin for each of the major versions:

* 1.0: 200.000 people
* 1.1: 500.000 people
* 1.2: 2.100.000 people
* 1.3 (current version): 4.000.000 people

We can clearly see that Kotlin has kept growing at a really nice rate which looks very promising for the language.
For JetBrains numbers like these are important as they give them the validation that their product is of good quality.
For them it was clear from the beginning that Kotlin had to have an open ecosystem.
One welcome to every body, open to anyone who wants to build on top of Kotlin.
It was always meant to be more than just a piece of software, it was meant for people united by ideas.

Andrey went a bit deeper on the Kotlin ecosystem and explained that they wanted Kotlin to become a default language regardless of level of experience, platform, scale, or type of application.
For them to achieve that, it was all about lowering barriers.

<img class="image fit" src="{{ '/img/kotlinconf-2019/keynote-2-kotlin-ecosystem.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Kotlin Ecosystem" />

### Different platforms
#### Server-side
Kotlin has been friends with Spring for a long time by now.
The first official support arrived since 2017 with Spring Boot, Web MVC, and Web Flux coroutines support.
Ktor, used for building asynchronous servers and clients in connected systems and also developed by JetBrains, is gaining more traction and is also used more and more at JetBrains.
Some other companies that have been using it are Expedia, Intuit and the Norway Tax Office.

#### Android
Android has been Kotlin-first since this year.
53% of professional Android developers work in Kotlin and 60% of the top 1.000 apps have been written in Kotlin.

JetBrains wants to further invest in mobile multi-platform for both Android and iOS by allowing business logic reuse between the different platforms.
Planboard, PlanGrid, Careem Driver's app, Cash App, Yandex Disk & Yandex Maps, Quizlet, and VMWare Workspace One are some of the apps where business logic is already been reused between the different platforms.

### What's coming in 1.4
Kotlin 1.4 is said to be released in Spring 2020 and a lot of focus is being put on quality and performance.
Currently 93% of users get code completion results under 500ms but in 1.4, code completion is said to become about 3x as fast.
IDE Gradle imports should also happen twice as fast and it should use 75% less memory.
A lot of improvements are also said to be done for Kotlin/Native compilation time.

### A new compiler
One of the biggest pains in Kotlin projects is the build speed, especially as the project get bigger.
This is why JetBrains has been working on a completely new compiler!
It is going to be fast, uniform and pluggable.
Some parts are coming in Kotlin 1.4 whereas others are coming in later versions.
They are aiming on 5x faster compilations.
This however won't be for version 1.4.

<img class="image fit" src="{{ '/img/kotlinconf-2019/keynote-3-new-kotlin-compiler-perf.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="New Kotlin compiler performance" />

The new compiler also comes with a new type inference and will ship in 1.4.
This will fix numerous bugs that they couldn't fix in the previous implementation as it was not flexible enough and it will enable new language features.
It can be evolved and extended to enable even more language features later on.

Kotlin has three different backends for Kotlin/JVM, Kotlin/JS and Kotlin/Native and in 1.4 they want to offer one single unified backend for all three of them.
Kotlin/Native was built from the beginning in this new unified infrastructure so Kotlin/JVM and Kotlin/JS both need to be migrated.
This way, if a bug gets fixed this will mean that it will be fixed for all platforms right away!

An experimental feature in 1.4 is KLIM, a new portable format.
This includes a new unified format used within the different platforms.

### Multi-platform

<img class="image fit" src="{{ '/img/kotlinconf-2019/keynote-4-kotlin-multiplatform.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Kotlin multi-platform" />

JetBrains want people to be able to share code and skills across 100% of the platform.
The idea is that you write common Kotlin logic that can be used in any platform that works ever where.
If you want to interact with a platform, you can interaction with platform specific versions of Kotlin.

Seeing as libraries are somewhat the bulk of the Kotlin ecosystem, it is clear for JetBrains that they need to pay enough attention to help people writing libraries.
They plan on doing this by adding a few tools to help people make libraries and to make their APIs robust and stable over time.
This will be achieved with a new library called Author's Mode that will demand explicit visibility and explicit public types where required.

JetBrains is also working on Dokka, a documentation generation tool that will support multi-platform libraries.

### Mobile multi-platform.
Coming in 2020 will be the possibility to run and debug iOS Kotlin apps in Android Studio through a closed-source plugin.
Note that this is not going to replace Xcode as you will still need it for certain things, but for the normal development cycle you will be able to stay within one IDE.

Kotlin/Native also already works on TvOS and WatchOS, and to demonstrate this, an app called Kotlin Locator was made to play a treasure hunting game during the conference.
And the app came with a WatchOS companion app so that you could try it out yourself.

### Browser multi-platform
A new feature has been added to allow quick reload in Kotlin/JS, similar to other frontend frameworks.
A lot of improvements were also done on the JS binary size, compressing it further down by quite a bit, reducing the final size of an app.
Work is also done on JavaScript operability with support for ES modules and Dukat which will connect Kotlin types with TypeScript types.

### WebAssembly + Kotlin
WebAssembly is a new web standard supported by all major browsers.
Basically it is a special virtual machine to run all kinds of different code and Kotlin wants to be run in there too.
Currently they have a prototype that they are working on.

### Data science in Kotlin
Not all users of Kotlin are programmers.
Data scientists have also been using Kotlin in combination with Jupyter, Spark and lets-plot.

### Language changes
KT-7770, created by Sergei Lebedev on May, 15th, 2015
Function interfaces: `fun interface`

<img class="image fit" src="{{ '/img/kotlinconf-2019/keynote-5-function-interfaces.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Function interfaces" />

A function interface has a single method and you can use it as a function type.
This also improves the java inoperability if you want to migrate Java code from Kotlin code without things breaking.

### Language evolutions
It is important for JetBrains to keep the language modern although they are aware that it is not very desired to have your code be broken in between updates.
If something becomes less useful it will be faded out and removed later to avoid legacy from building up.
In general updating from one version to another should remain easy and desired.
JetBrains will provide feedback loop to keep developers informed of upcoming changes and to stay in touch with the community.
If migrations are necessary, they will provide the necessary guides or tools to help developers migrate their code.

## Putting down the golden hammer by [Huyen Tue Dao](https://twitter.com/queencodemonkey){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
<span class="image right"><img class="p-image" style="max-width: 200px" alt="Andrey Breslav" src="/img/kotlinconf-2019/huyen-tue-dao.jpg"></span>

> I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer,
> to treat everything as if it were a nail. - Abraham H. Maslow

Huyen started her talk with the quote above.
Given a new tool or framework, it is common for people to get a bit too enthusiastic with it and to exaggerate in the usage of it, treating it as a golden hammer.

Huyen explained to us that she questioned herself on how to better write Kotlin code.
And in particular by avoiding her own hammers and biases.
As background information she told us that she worked with Java and C++ before she got into touch with Kotlin.

The main anchor that caused her to question herself was the [keynote from KotlinConf 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsaFVLr8t4E){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} where the following was mentioned by Andrey Breslav:
> Our main focus, our main motto was to make a pragmatic language.
> Getting things done, and turning your thoughts into working software without jumping through hoops.

Experienced developers praise the following regarding code:
* Readability over concision
* Reuse over Expressiveness
* Interoperability over originality
* Safety/tooling over Soundness

Based on that, the following questions came up to her:
* "When might we be using Kotlin features as golden hammers?"
* "How can we use these features more pragmatically and hopefully write better Kotlin"

Some hammer-proofing points to ponder:
* Readability
* Reusability
* Maintainability
* Intentionality

### Type inference

<img class="image fit" src="{{ '/img/kotlinconf-2019/golden-hammer-1-type-inference.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Type inference" />

Kotlin has a smart compiler that can infer things like the type of a variable.
The hinting feature in IntelliJ helps a lot with showing the exact type of a value or object as sometimes it might be possible that you expected a certain type but it's actually a different one.

For example, when declaring a list of numbers but also adding a string to it, causes it to change the list's type to a list of `Any`.
If we would want to have a compiler error for this we would need to define the type explicitly like `val crewlist: List<String>`.

Something to keep in mind in this case is that we should not depend too much on the hinting feature as you can only see these in IntelliJ and not for example when reviewing a pull request.
It is important to have the code speak for itself, in that way it is important to explicitly specify the type in certain cases.

### Implicit parameter

<img class="image fit" src="{{ '/img/kotlinconf-2019/golden-hammer-2-implicit-parameter.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Implicit parameter" />

Depending on the context, it is not always easy to tell what the `it` stands for.
Especially in a complex context, you should rather specify the variables to be more explicit.

### Scope functions
<img class="image fit" src="{{ '/img/kotlinconf-2019/golden-hammer-3-scope-function.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Scope functions" />

It it easy to exaggerate in the usage of scope functions such as `apply`, `also`, `let`, `run`, `with`.
We should be weary of combining too much of these as it causes us to lose track of what a `this` exactly represents and it creates unnecessary complexity making maintenance more difficult.

Do not feel obligated to stretch yourself or your code because it does not feel Kotlin-y enough as Kotlin is meant to be a pragmatic language.
The code above can be rewritten as follows:

<img class="image fit" src="{{ '/img/kotlinconf-2019/golden-hammer-4-scope-function-improved.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Scope functions improved" />

### Extension functions
We can define extension functions to extend existing APIs that you may otherwise not control without subclassing.
A good practice is to make use of this to keep classes and APIs minimal, only containing intrinsic properties and behaviours and to keep your class abstractions pure.

Huyen mentioned the [Kotlin for Java Developers Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/kotlin-for-java-developers){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} in which the question was asked on why extension functions are so popular.
We can exaggerate with extension functions for example if you make every single function an extension function of an existing class.
We should think about what makes a good utility to a class and we should not make extension functions of too specific functions but keep them as regular functions.

### Nullability and nullable types

<img class="image fit" src="{{ '/img/kotlinconf-2019/golden-hammer-5-nullability.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Nullability" />

`?` and `!!` can be valid ways of handling nulls **with** thought to intentionality and maintainability.
Kotlin has nullable types whereas Java does not.
If you pull in Java methods into the Kotlin world you can stumble upon cases where it is not clear if something is nullable or not, resulting into unchecked nullability issues.

Null safety checks with `?` can be bad too and can obfuscate both good assumptions and bad assumptions.
Failing silently is often a bad and undesired thing.
Because of that, it can be a good approach to prefer to use `!!`.
`!!` is not inherently evil but requires careful use.
Based on good asumption or because you just KNOW that a value is non-null.

## Your First Server with Ktor by [Big Nerd Ranch](https://twitter.com/bignerdranch){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" style="max-width: 200px" alt="Big Nerd Ranch" src="/img/kotlinconf-2019/big-nerd-ranch.png"></span>

This was a workshop on trying out Ktor and serves as a nice introduction to the framework.
Ktor, backed by JetBrains, is a web framework for building asynchronous servers and clients in Kotlin.

Before starting, it is required that you install the IntelliJ Ktor plugin via the Plugins menu.
After doing so, you can start a new Ktor project from within IntelliJ.
An alternative way of doing so is by going via the [Ktor Project Generator](https://start.ktor.io){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
Something worth noting is that the `application.conf` file is written in [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

The [instructions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18VFCLxl_1hNMvKi1lLDKMr0bIaJ2gIll/view){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} of the workshops together with the [TXT file](File with the different names: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tRv2le4PllBT_NC-ipY7WUySPe1NV41Z/view){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} that is supposed to be read during the exercises can both be found on Google Drive.
You will learn how to set up your IDE, starting your Ktor application, and routing and serving data.

## New product announcement
<img class="image fit" src="{{ '/img/kotlinconf-2019/special-announcement-1-intro.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Intro" />
At the end of the first day it was time to announce JetBrains' newest product!
<span class="image right"><img class="p-image" style="max-width: 200px" alt="Maxim Shafirov" src="/img/kotlinconf-2019/maxim-shafirov.png"></span>

Everything started with a ticket created 15 years ago by Maxim Shafirov, the CEO of JetBrains.
The ticket was about a request to improve collaboration between teams.

<img class="image fit" src="{{ '/img/kotlinconf-2019/special-announcement-2-ticket-ceo.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Ticket CEO" />

Maxim shortly went over how JetBrains came to be.
20 years ago, three developers came together and created a product to help them refactor some code.
By now, JetBrains has created over 20 products based on their own needs.
During the growth of the company from 3 developers to 1.200 people, JetBrains faced many challenges on working together between all the different teams.

Creating a product involves more than just a development tool, you have to take into account version control, chat applications for communicating, write documentation and issue tracking.
Besides developers, you have other teams within a company such as testers, HR and marketing.
A challenge many companies face is to efficiently cooperate with all teams which is why JetBrains wanted to create a tool specifically for this.

Meet [Space](https://www.jetbrains.com/space/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}!

[Maarten Balliauw](https://twitter.com/maartenballiauw){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} gave a demo on how Space can be used within a company.
And also to give us an impression on the look and feel.

<img class="image fit" src="{{ '/img/kotlinconf-2019/special-announcement-4-look-and-feel.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Look and feel" /> 

At the end of the demo, Maxim returned to share the prices.
Note that a free version is available!

<img class="image fit" src="{{ '/img/kotlinconf-2019/special-announcement-5-prices.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Prices" />

On the [website](https://www.jetbrains.com/space/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} you can request an invite to try out Spaces.
Attendees of KotlinConf have a guaranteed spot to try it out.
More info is available in the [blogpost](https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2019/12/05/welcome-to-space/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} on JetBrains' website.
We think that JetBrains is very ambitious with Space but given good their products have been until now we are convinced that this will make another great product of them.

## Kotlin in Space by [Maxim Mazin](https://twitter.com/maximmazin){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" style="max-width: 200px" alt="Maxim Mazin" src="/img/kotlinconf-2019/maxim-mazin.jpg"></span>

At the end of the first conference day, JetBrains announced their new collaboration tool, Space.
During the session they covered how they've been using the tool themselves at JetBrains.
Maxim was a lead of the Teamcity team.

Full-stack Kotlin.
Shared Kotlin model: data model, view model, validation, rpc, utils and common libs.
Not shared: UI. Important to have it look native. And storage.

### Used frameworks
Exposed: Type-safe SQL and ORM
Easy to initialize database and to track your model to help you with migration scripts.
Can define entities that map to tables for example `EUser`.

Ktor.
Open source.
Both server and client.
Multi-platform client.
Asynchronous, non-blocking.

Initialize and run a server from code.
Specify routes in a simple way based on a path and a suspend code block.
WebSocket support.
Assign a lambda to a url.
onConnect, onMessage, onClose and onError all implemented in a single flow thanks to Coroutines instead of seperate methods.

Implemented own WebSocket RPC.
Permissions are checked, transactions are opened and a result in returned.

With Kotlin fullstack it is easy to check for usages to find dead pieces of code.
Administrator playground API to play around with things.
Open API (Swagger) JSON is generated if you don't want to use Kotlin.
Kotlin-react available on JetBrains' GitHub: kotlin-wrappers.
Inherit from components and implement a render function.

Styled components
Kotlin DSL for styled components
Type safe CSS declarations.
Available on JetBrains' GitHub: kotlin-wrappers.

### Testing
Server tests
AssertK is used.
Sentences as method names

Web client tests
Enzyme used underneat

Webdriver tests
JUnit
Selenium + Library by Jandex (?)
Allure for reports.
Screenshot when test fails.

### Build
Grade scripts for builds.

Fullstack Kotlin developers so everyone can work on everything although some people do have a prefers.


## Coroutines! gotta catch âem all! by [Florina Muntenescu](https://twitter.com/FMuntenescu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Manuel Vivo](https://twitter.com/manuelvicnt){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

## What the F(p) is Kotlin? by [Shelby Cohen](https://twitter.com/shelbyc0hen){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Katie Levy](https://twitter.com/klevy110){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
Shelby Cohen and Katie Levy shared with us the story of how they managed to introduce functional programming via Kotlin into their organisation.

They presented an 8-step guide on how to influence colleagues and thus Intuit to adopt Kotlin:
### Find your Passion
Find something you want to be passionate about. In this case, it's Kotlin.
### Socialize
Share you passion with other people.
Try to find some things you like about Kotlin - or anything new for that matter - and tell about it to your colleagues.
Give some examples on how Kotlin removes ceremony compared to Java.
Spread the word on how Kotlin has null-safety built in the type system.

### Proof of Concept
Don't only talk about Kotlin. Put the deed to the word and have something to show to your peers.
Develop a new feature and have it reviewed and discussed by the others.
This should open the discussion with seniors developers and architects on whether the new technology should be embraced, put on hold or avoided.
Having a POC and other developers on board tends to help this conversation.

### Create a Plan
The light is green and you are allowed to switch to Kotlin. 
But other developers will still be hesitant in their Kotlin skills.
Katie and Shelby put together a plan to migrate to make the switch from Java.
The provided online training to teach the basic features of Kotlin.
This increased the confidence and comfort of the team to make the jump.

By setting goals, they were able to switch at a comfortable pace:
- Starting with migrating and writing Kotlin tests which don't impact production code
- Migrate easy wins such as data classes
- Only then start adding new features in Kotlin

They also monitored what their changes were doing to the stability of the product:
- Less crashes because of the improved type system (less NPEs)
- Features were written faster in Kotlin
- Less lines of code (to maintain and read)

Try to provide feedback but watch out to not push learners too much.
Some Kotlin code will look a bit Java-y at first, but this will improve overtime.

### Persuade with Data
The other engineers on the team might not (yet) share your passion of Kotlin, so use some data to persuade them even more.
Some numbers that can be used:
- [Kotlin uses 40% less lines of code than Java](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/faq.html#what-advantages-does-kotlin-give-me-over-the-java-programming-language)
- More concise code takes less time to write and less time to read
- Show examples on how Kotlin removes boilerplate code
- The growing amount of big corporations who made the leap to Kotlin
- [4th Most loved language on the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages)

### Deconstruct Myths
Even with all this data, there are still some myths that exist concerning Kotlin which you do not want to spread.
Shelby and Katie broke down these myths in a [technical whitepaper](https://www.intuit.com/blog/uncategorized/kotlin-development-plan/) which they talk about on [Medium](https://medium.com/@srcohen1/kotlin-development-plan-5141087eaef0).
 
### Can't stop, Won't Stop
At this point, the team was on board, the train started going full-speed. 
This is when they started a learning community to get other teams on board and to spread the word.
They would give presentations, do live coding and code reviews to help others get started too.

### Connect with Larger Community
Kotlin has an amazing community, which allows you to grow even further.
Katie mentions working on an [OpenSource project](https://github.com/intuit/truffle-shuffle), attending conferences and [podcasts](https://talkingkotlin.com/).

## Going Native: How I used Kotlin Native to Port 6 years of Android Game Code to iOS in 6 months. by [Ana Redmond](https://twitter.com/anaredmond){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
TODO (Michael), nog WIP

Ana Redmond of Infinut presented us with a really nice feel good story about how she made her android games available for ios.
She noticed her daughters' faces when they came home with another math assignment.
Needless to say, it wasn't the most happy face.
She noticed her kids were trying to memorize the rules instead of really grasping the material.
That's when she realized she could make small games so her kids would not only learn maths better but also enjoy the process.

She created a vast library of over 60 educational games and 120+ lessons for Android devices over a period of 6 years.
Many kids were learning math and enjoying it.
Unfortunately, the many kids who use an iPad were left out without access to the material she brought to the Android platform.
So when Ana heard about Kotlin/Native she decided the time was right to serve those kids as well!

Kotlin/Native is used to compile Kotlin code to platforms where virtual machines are not desirable or possible,
such as iOS.
Ana wanted to write a game once in shared Kotlin code
