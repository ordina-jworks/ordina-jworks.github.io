## Going Native: How I used Kotlin Native to Port 6 years of Android Game Code to iOS in 6 months. by [Ana Redmond](https://twitter.com/anaredmond){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
TODO (Michael), nog WIP

Ana Redmond of Infinut presented us with a really nice feel good story about how she made her android games available for ios.
She noticed her daughters' faces when they came home with another math assignment.
Needless to say, it wasn't the most happy face.
She noticed her kids were trying to memorize the rules instead of really grasping the material.
That's when she realized she could make small games so her kids would not only learn maths better but also enjoy the process.

She created a vast library of over 60 educational games and 120+ lessons for Android devices over a period of 6 years.
Many kids were learning math and enjoying it.
Unfortunately, the many kids who use an iPad were left out without access to the material she brought to the Android platform.
So when Ana heard about Kotlin/Native she decided the time was right to serve those kids as well!

Kotlin/Native is used to compile Kotlin code to platforms where virtual machines are not desirable or possible,
such as iOS.
Ana wanted to write a game once in shared Kotlin code
