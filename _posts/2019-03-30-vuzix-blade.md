## Introduction

As we are strong believers in the potential that Augmented Reality has to offer in terms of business cases we were wanting to get our hands on some actual hardware.
We acquired some budget and went looking for 'affordable' smart glasses to experiment with.

We came across the Vuzix Blade on the Vuzix website and looked through the details and videos posted.
After acquiring the required budget, thanks Ordina, we preordered one unit.

It was a video like this one that had won us over to give the Vuzix Blade a try since the displayed features look very nice, if they all worked as promised...

After a very long wait, with several delays and a lot of mailing back and forth we got ourselves a preproduction hand built Vuzix Blade.
We got these glasses to analyze the wearers experience and see how we could integrate it into the numerous business cases we can see it being used for:

- Assistance for field technicians
- Order picking
- Communications platforms
- Tracking performance for athletes

In this blogpost we'll go a bit into detail what makes the Vuzix Blade tick and how our experience with it has been so far.
Read on ahead for all the juicy details!

## The hardware

<img alt="Vuzix Blade hardware overview" src="{{ '/img/2019-03-30-vuzix/vuzix-hardware-overview.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto; max-width: 800px;">
The Vuzix Blade is well built, and pretty comfortable even when worn for longer durations.
The hardware inside the glasses is alright but nothing special:
- Projected display resolution of 480 by 853 pixels
- Quad core ARM A53 cpu
- WiFi, Bluetooth
- 8MP camera up to 720 video recording
- 470mAh

The amount of RAM is not specified but seems to be just the right amount to get the job done.
Overall the device works but the speed and fluidity could be better, although this was improved significantly with the latest software update.
The display is bright and has good visibility but there is no audio on the device as no regular or bone conducting speaker is present.
Audio can be provided through either Bluetooth or USB audio, but an included speaker would have been nicer.
Video recording works but is barely usable because there is no OIS and the frame rate, even at only 720P.
For a concept device it really shows what the technology is capable of.
With some enhancements in the future this will certainly provide an added value in many uses cases.

For an additional markup it is possible to get prescription lenses with these glasses so people who wear glasses on daily basis can also use this device.

Battery life is functional for an hour or 2-3 but for all day use an external battery pack is definitely a requirement.

## The software

TODO: The software: some photos & videos about the built in software, what the experience is like...

## Using the Vuzix

TODO: Using the Vuzix, add photos & videos

## Developing for the Vuzix

TODO: Developing for the Vuzix: show work in progress on the heart rate app.

## Looking forward

What we have looks already promising even though a little rough right now.
Vuzix rolled out a big software update for the device that included new features like Alexa support and improved camera performance, but we think it can still be improved upon a lot!

If and when better battery technology is available these devices can have a definite positive influence on certain business cases.
With the introduction of the second generation HoloLens from Microsoft it is clear what can be possible with these devices.
Although the HoloLens is a much much more complicated product than the Vuzix Blade.

TODO: Extend & finish up the blogpost with a nice conclusion
