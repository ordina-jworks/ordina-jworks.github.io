## Introduction

As we are strong believers in the potential that Augmented Reality has to offer in terms of business cases we were wanting to get our hands on some actual hardware.
We acquired some budget and went looking for 'affordable' smart glasses to experiment with.

We came across the Vuzix Blade on the Vuzix website and looked through the details and videos posted.
After acquiring the required budget, thanks Ordina, we preordered one unit.

It was a video like this one that had won us over to give the Vuzix Blade a try since the displayed features look very nice, if they all worked as promised...

After a very very long wait, with several delays and a lot of mailing back and forth we got ourselves a preproduction hand built Vuzix Blade.
We got these glasses to analyze the wearers experience and see how we could integrate it into the numerous business cases we can see it being used for:

- Assistance for field technicians
- Order picking
- TODO
- TODO

In this blogpost we'll go a bit into detail what makes the Vuzix Blade tick and how our experience with it has been so far.
Read on ahead for all the juicy details!
