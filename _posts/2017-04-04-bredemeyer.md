Software architecture is getting a lot of attention. 
It looks beyond the details of todayâ€™s technologies to the underlying trends, techniques, and principles that underpin lasting success in our fast-moving field.
It is critical to today's business success, yet it requires technical, business and organizational talents and skills that warrant their own path of career development, education, and research.

Last week, I participated in a four-day workshop organised by [Bredemeyer Consulting](http://www.bredemeyer.com/) in the Netherlands. 
The [goal](http://www.bredemeyer.com/contact.htm) of the workshop: Helping good architects become _great_ architects. 
Bredemeyer Consulting intends to inspire and encourage architects to greatness, by helping them to visualize what is possible, and see how to get there.
They achieved this by providing the tools and techniques to help architects be successful. 
The training covers the essential technical tasks of architecting (architecture modeling and specification, architecture tradeoff analysis, component design and specification, etc.) as well as architectural leadership skills.
