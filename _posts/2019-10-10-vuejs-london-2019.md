## It's London baby!

As it is a goal of me to focus more on Vue this year, I had the opportunity to travel to London to attend [VueJS London 2019](https://vuejs.london).
With a conference on the 4th of October and a workshop provided by [VueVixens](https://vuevixens.org) on the 5th October, I was hoping to learn a lot about the future developments of Vue.
The conference and the workshop delivered on my expectations as we learned about accessibility, animations, data visualisations, performance, the new Composition API and much more.
We even had a conference call with Evan You where he announced that Vue3 was going open source while I had the opportunity to play around with the brand new Composition API during the workshop.
In this blog post, I will highlight some key elements that I have learned during the conference and workshop and I highly recommend to check out the videos // TODO: add them

# Conference day

The conference was held at O2 Cineworld, which is not that far from the city center.
As a venue, this was exquisite as the food was great, the accomodation was top-notch and // TODO

## Animations any Vue app can use, by [Adam Jahr](https://twitter.com/adamjahr)

In a scattered world, the attention of the user of our web applications is often lost quickly.
We really need to capture the user his attention and make sure that they focus on what we want them to focus on.
For example in a web shop when the user is looking at the details of a product, we want to make sure he knows exactly where the buy button is.
To achieve this, we can simply divert his attention to this button by adding a small but effective animation.
We want to inspire a certain action that will keep the user on the happy path of our application, whether that is selling a product, successfully entering the details for a client registration or something other specific to our application.
With the help of the Vue directives `v-enter`, `v-enter-active`, `v-enter-to`, `v-leave`, `v-leave-active` and `v-leave-to` we have the tools to add the necessary CSS classes that define certain states such as the default state, the hovered state and others.

Adam has written a full course that can be found on [VueMastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/animating-vue/why-animate) and there's also an introduction on [VueMastery's Medium](https://medium.com/vue-mastery/intro-to-vue-animations-df9594b48800).

## Scripting in style, what's your Vue?, by [Maya Shavin](https://twitter.com/MayaShavin)

Currently CSS has a lot of scaling issues:

* Everything is put into a global namespace
* There are implicit dependencies
* A lot of dead code can exist and is not easily found
* If you have multiple CSS files, there is a non-deterministic order

With the use of scoped CSS, we can already tackle a lot of these issues.
Vue not only provides us with the tools to add CSS styling next to our component definition but also CSS that is specific for a component.
This is with the help of the `scoped` attribute that we can add to our styling:
```
<style scoped>
/* your CSS here */
</style>
```
But we still need to watch out as some other rules might be more specific from within another component.
We are also lacking certain functionalities such as scripting in our styles.

With the use of [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), we can already alleviate several scaling issues as we get certain functionalities such as composition.
Sadly we can not solve all scaling issues that we experience with regular CSS such as the fact we do not have an easy way for theming.

One method of solving the remaining problems is by using [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com) for which there exists a Vue plugin called [vue-styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/vue-styled-components).
The idea behind styled components is to utilise tagged template literals to write actual CSS in your JS.
We can thus write a styled `input` tag that has a switch to set a primary and secondary state like this:
```ts
import styled from 'vue-styled-components';

const btnProps = { primary: Boolean };
const StyledButton = styled('button', btnProps)`
  padding: 0.25em 1em;
  border: 2px solid palevioletred;
  border-radius: 3px;
  background: ${props => props.primary ? 'palevioletred' : 'white'};
  color: ${props => props.primary ? 'white' : 'palevioletred'};
`;

export default StyledButton;
```

## Identifying and solving performance issues in Vue applications, by [Filip Rakowski](https://twitter.com/filrakowski)

"Every millisecond counts", a statement that holds a lot of truth as studies have shown (TODO: add studies).
To make sure that every millisecond is won and that you get the most out of your application, there are certain actions we can take on our source code to directly improve the speed of our application.

### Lazy loading routes

By default most people will define their routes as such:

```
const routes = [
	// TODO: complete
];
```

By changing our import statements for our components we can directly impact the bundle size.
When we used to have this:
```
import Product from 'product.vue';
```
we now rewrite it to this:
```
const Product = () => import('product.vue');
```
The result is that our bundle size can get a lot smaller as components are only loaded when they are actually requested for that specific page.
With the help of BundleAnalyzer, we visualise this. // TODO: add example?

### Using tree-shakeable packages

An example package that is often used in web applications is `lodash`.
By default, `lodash` is not tree-shakeable but with the introduction of `lodash-es`, we now have access to all functions of `lodash` that are tree-shakeable.
So instead of:
```
import { last, zip } from 'lodash'
```
We can now use:
```
import { last, zip } from 'lodash-es'
```

With the help of [bundlephobia.com](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=lodash-es), we can see the individual sizes of all the lodash packages.
If we do not use functions such as `differenceBy` from lodash, we can shave of a couple of kilobytes from our bundle size.

### Activate dynamic imports of child components

When a page is loaded, not all child components are required to also be loaded in.
The reason for this is that not all child components are directly visible.
This can be because they are somewhere on the bottom of the page, off screen.
But another big reason can be because they are used to render a modal.
As not all modals are always directly needed when the page is opened, we can add a `v-if` to that component.
For example in a product page where we can have a modal with more product details, we might have something like:
```
<template>
	<div class="product">
		...
		<ProductDetails v-model="product">
		...
	</div>
</template>
```
With adding a v-if that holds a boolean to tell if the model should be visible, we delay the actual execution of all the `ProductDetails` code, thus achieving a performance increase:
```
<template>
	<div class="product">
		...
		<ProductDetails v-if="isProductDetailsOpened" v-model="product">
		...
	</div>
</template>
```

### Prefetching

Prefetching is a technique in which we use the idle time of our web page to load other assets.
This is a much used technique in for example an infinite scroll where we can already preload one of the next elements that would be shown when the user scrolls down.
Another example is to prefetch the components that we are lazy loading for our pages.
Thanks to webpack we can [add a specific comment](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#prefetchingpreloading-modules) to accommodate this behaviour:
```
const Product = () => import(/* webpackPrefetch:true */ "product.vue")
```

### More performance wins

In order to further improve the performance of our web application, we can:

* Lazy load images
* Use functional components for lists
* Optimise initial state when using ServerSide Rendering
* Cache static assets in a Service Worker

## Scalable data visualisation with D3 and Vue, by [Ramona Biscoveanu](https://twitter.com/CodesOfRa)

When wanting to do data visualistions with D3 in a Vue web application, it often happens that Vue is only used as a shelf for the actual D3 code.
This is inherently a bad idea as the D3 code gets complex, not maintainable and it is also not reactive.
We can use the functionalities of Vue to generate part of our D3 code.
Since a lot of D3 can be rendered declaratively in HTML code, we can use Vue to bind all the data to the necessary attributes.
In our component, we could have something like:
```
<template>
	<svg :width="width" :height="height">
		<path
			v-for="(d, index) in data"
			:d="generateLine(d.values, index)"
			:key="d.country"
			:stroke="colours(index)"
			:stroke-width="selected(index)"
			fill="none"
			@mouseover="onSelected(d, index)"
			@click="onClick(d)"
		></path>
	</svg>
</template>
```

By using `data` and `computed` we can retrieve the correct data from within our Vue component.

An excellent code example of this can be found on [Ramona's GitHub](https://github.com/CodesOfRa/d3-vue-graph/blob/master/src/components/Tree.vue) with the [live application available online](https://outofmylens-flowers.netlify.com/).

## A new router to guide your apps, by [Eduardo San Martin Morote](https://twitter.com/posva)

There are three kinds of routers possible:

* Imperative: we define the routes and add a callback function to determine how the page should be rendered. An example of this is [page.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js).
* Declarative: routes are defined on a component level by using for example a specific attribute. The [Reach Router](https://reach.tech/router/) is an example of this.
* Configuration based: routes are defined separately with the components that they are linked to. The Vue router is a configuration based router.

Because of this configuration based nature of the `vue-router`, we are missing the option to add or remove routes and we can also not have declarative routing.

The current implementation of `vue-router` has a lot of functionalities built in that are specific to managing the history while we actually want to separate this.
In an ideal situation, we want the router to be the connection between the components and the code that manages the browser history.
When a user navigates to a new page, the router calls the history code to add the new page to the history.
While when nagivating back, the router retrieves the previous page.
In the current implementation, this is all not clearly separated.

So what are the next steps for the Vue router?
One major improvement would be the use of TypeScript as this would help developers on using the Vue router in the correct way.

Another improvement lies in the use of a ranking system for the routes.
Currently routes are checked for a match based on the order in which they are defined.
This means that a catch-all route such as `(.*)` in the beginning of the routes definition would render the other routes useless.

A major addition to Vue router would be the ability to have dynamic routing.
Components could thus add or remove routes.

A final addition would be the full use of the Composition API so we have functionalities such as `useLink`, `useLocation`, `onBeforeRouteLeave` and `onBeforeRouteUpdate`.

### Awesome JS is Awesome, by [Guillaume Chau](https://twitter.com/Akryum)
In the [awesome-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue) repository we can already find a curated list of interesting resources for when you want to develop an application with Vue.
Guillaume decided to create a specific website that has an overview of all good packages for your project, whether it is a Vue project or a Nuxt project or others.
The website is available at [awesomejs.dev](https://awesomejs.dev/) and will keep on growing with new project types and packages added regularly.

## Vue3's Composition API explained visually, by [Gregg Pollack](https://twitter.com/greggpollack)

With the upcoming arrival of the Composition API, a visual explanation of the possible changes to your code was very useful.
The Composition API allows you to focus more on the features instead of only the components.
While in the past your components would become a clutter of all your features together spread out over your component, the Composition API allows them to be grouped together.

// TODO: add image

## The new Composition API, by [Thorsten Luenborg](https://twitter.com/linus_borg)

After we had the visual explanation of what the Composition API encompasses, it was time to dive into more details and some example code as can be found on [Thorsten's GitHub](https://github.com/LinusBorg/composition-api-demos).

With the Composition API we would introduce the use of a `setup` method for each component.
In this `setup`, we declare the scope that will be available to our template.
While in the Options API we defined our scope in the `data`, `props`, `methods`, `computed` and `watch` properties and they are bound to the object instance, we now can group all this scope into `setup`.
With the Composition API we have the freedom to group our features in the `setup` method and even extract them into separate functions so they can be reused in other components.

For example when you have a component that supports multiple features such as sorting and pagination, these features would be spread out over the component.
The data necessary for the sorting and pagination would be put into `data` and `props`.
The functions that actually implement these functionalities would be scattered over `methods`, `computed` and `watch`.
Thanks to the portable reactivity of the Composition API, we can simplify our components that use for example pagination to:
```ts
import usePagination from './use-pagination'
export default {
	setup() {
		const pagination = usePagination({
			perPage: 10,
			items: [1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 100],
		});
		// other features defined here
		return { pagination };
	}
}
```
`usePagination` is a function that encapsulates all functionality specific for pagination:
```ts
export function usePagination(settings) {
	const data = reactive({
		perPage: 20,
		currentPage: 1,
		...settings
	});
	const amountOfPages = computed(() => Math.ceil(settings.items / perPage));
	// other functionalities here
	return {
		...toRefs(data),
		amountOfPages
	};
}
```
In our component we will then be able to use `currentPage`, `amountOfPages` and such, just like when we would have defined them in `data` and `computed`.

All slides can be found on [Thorsten's GitHub](https://github.com/LinusBorg/talks/raw/master/2019-10-04%20Vuejs%20London/New%20composition%20API%20%20-%20Vue.js%20London%202019-10-04.pdf).

## Live coding: the new Composition API, by [Jason Yu](https://twitter.com/ycmjason)

The best way to get to know the new Composition API is seeing it live in action.
So Jason took the challenge upon himself to live code something called a `KeyboardKeyboard`.
As a musician and a programmer, he is very enthusiastic about keyboards.
So he decided to program his computer keyboard to sound like a piano keyboard.
With the use of Web Audio API he managed to program a web app with Composition API in just over 30 minutes.
The source code can be found at [his GitHub repository](https://github.com/ycmjason-talks/2019-10-04-vuejs-london-conference-2019).
It was a fun live coding session as he was able to really captive the audience's attention.
You can check out his screen capture on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K5zbgJ_z9w).

## Evan You's keynote: launch of Vue3 open-source, by [Evan You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi)

We ended the conference with a keynote from Evan You, the creator of Vue.
There was already a lot of talk about Vue 3 in the last couple of months and in this keynote he had a great preview of what the power of Vue 3 will look like.
For Vue 3, he and his core team have been very active to rewrite the whole project.
By rewriting the whole runtime and compiler from scratch, they were able to add native TypeScript support everywhere.
They were also able to make the compiler completely modular.
With the addition of block-tree optimisation, // TODO: find out more about this
A major announcement about the upcoming Vue 3 is the fact that it is fully tree shakeable.
// TODO: add info about hoisting

Tree shakeability in combination with all the other upcoming features will result in a major performance improvement as Evan briefly demonstrated.
The current speed improvement is already 9-fold // TODO: check way of saying this
With some features still in development, Evan expects an even bigger improvement in speed before the actual release of Vue 3.

As a special treat, Evan had set the visibility of the repository from private to public.
From 4th October onwards, Vue 3 is fully open source.

# Workshop: hands-on with the Composition API, by [Vue Vixens](https://twitter.com/VueVixens)

With almost half of the conference day spent on talks about the new Composition API, the opportunity to actually incorporate it into a workshop was taken by the VueVixens.
VueVixens is an organisation by women, for women that have an interest in Vue.
The workshop was held at CCT Venues, not that far from the O2 Cineworld.

The first goal of the workshop was to implement our own version of a Spotify client in the browser, built with the Composition API in Vue.
Sadly Spotify has limited the use of their SDK to only premium users of Spotify.
So after having gotten a good explanation about what the Composition API is made of with the some interesting discussions on how to use it, we changed it up a bit.

VueVixens also organises other workshops and one of them is more aimed at beginners in Vue.
We took the solution to that workshop and decided we were going to rewrite it to the Composition API.
Since almost everybody present had been at the conference the day before and the Composition API was well explained, we were able to finish up quickly.

# Conclusion
