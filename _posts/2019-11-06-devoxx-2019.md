## Introduction

Devoxx Belgium is a Java community conference in Antwerp, Belgium.
Every year in November it is organised and always has a great assortment of bleeding edge technology talks, methodology talks and architectual insights. 

During this edition about 30 JWorks colleagues joined talks at Devoxx.
Ordina again had a very popular booth by providing attendees nachos, the venue is a cinema after all.

## Keynotes

### The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Diversity (Don't panic!)

// TODO add speaker details here. 

This talks, following the same format at the similar titelled book, provides an chapter by chapter overview of the struggles and issues with diversity in our industry and what steps our community can take to improve it.
The key takeaway is to be at least aware of the issue and to try to be sensitive to undertones in jokes and messages towards all members of our community, especially as they might not seem harmful at first sight.

### Qualities of a Highly Effective Architect

A typical Venkat talk.
In a funny but straightforward way he explained the pitfalls, does and don'ts for architects.
He provided a 12 point guideline that all architects should adhere to.
'Prototype beats any arguments' and 'Every technical decision should have an expiration label' are just a few examples.

## Talks

### Running Kafka in Kubernetes: a practical guide

This is a talk by Katherine Stanley from IBM.
She works in the IBM Event Streams project.

This talk provides a good overview of common pitfalls with setting up Kafka on a Kubernetes cluster.
Katherine introduces all basic concepts, so following this talk is possible without a ton of Kafka and Kubernetes knowledge.
Katherine discusses how several Kubernetes constructs are used to support and enabled the usage of Kafka and Zookeeper.
Liveness and readiness probes, Statefull sets, Pod anti affinity, Persistant volumes and headless services are all discussed.
Lastly Katherine discusses the different options for running and managing a Kafka cluster on Kubernetes.
Both the IBM Events Helm charts and Strimzi are shown and discussed.
Strimzi is an operator that allows Kafka cluster to be created and managed through CRDS in Kubernetes.

### Kubernetes Faster and Easier

Ray Tsang is a developer advocate for the Google Cloud Platform.
He is a Java Champion and works on improving the usability of GCP for Java usecases.

Ray shows some tools and their usecases when developing Java applications on Kubernetes. 
Most tools are shown in a small demo. 

Discussed tools

* [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
* [Java Memory Calculator](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack-memory-calculator){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
* [Jib]()
* [k3s](https://k3s.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
* [Kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
* [Skaffold]()
* [Graceful shutdown library](https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/springboot-graceful-shutdown)

He also provides some common pitfalls when developing Java for Kubernetes.
He refers to his talk about common [docker pitfalls](https://saturnism.me/talk/docker-tips-and-tricks/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. 

Finally he showed a demo of how an IntelliJ plugin when combined with Skaffold can allow a developer to debug a live running container on a Kubernetes cluster, straight from their local machine. Side note, this is super cool!

### Observing Chaos

Juraci Paixão Kröhling is a SE at RedHat working on the Kiali team and a maintainer of Jaeger Tracing.

He provides a brief overview of the basic concepts of a services mesh, it's inner workings with a sidecar and their advantages and issues.
Next, he discussed how different features of a service mesh can solve common concerns w.r.t. routing, resiliency, security, observability and distributed tracing.

The last part of the talk is an extensive demo of the four tools/technologies discussed in the talk: Jaeger, Istio, Quarkus and Kiala.
A demo service is deployed and a distributed tracing example scenario is shown and discussed.

### What happens after your startup is acquired?

This was an amazing talk by Renata Tamasi, founder of Samebug and currently working at Rollbar.

During this talk, she took us through the journey of running and later-on selling her start-up to Rollbar.
She starts by showing the struggles they had to get the start-up going in Europe and what the pitfalls they uncovered during journey.
Simply put, getting a SaaS based start-up off the ground and making is succesfull in Europe is almost impossible without the founders moving to the US.
During their journey, Renata explained the different paths they tried with Samebug ranging from trying to raise funding for their start-up to finally getting aquired by Rollbar.
This is a must see talk for everyone who wants to join a start-up and it will be very familiar for anyone who was in a start-up at one point in time.

## Conclusion

One of the takeaways from this conference is that the diversity in our industry is still an issue that we surely need to tackle as a community.
Both during a keynote as in other talks, clear statements were made that our industry is still struggling to embrace diversity and provide the same opportunities to all groups of our society.
// TODO, can we add this? And if so, can we add a statement on how we help solving this in JWorks? (Looked on the Ordina website, but didn't find anything specifically)

Another interesting insight is that Kubernetes now is the defacto deployment platform for Java applications moving forward.
During the conference a lot of tools and integrations with IDEs have been showcased and every talk just assumes that the deployment platform is Kubernetes.
