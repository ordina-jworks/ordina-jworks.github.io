## Introduction

Devoxx Belgium is a Java community conference in Antwerp, Belgium.
Every year in November it is organised and always has a great assortment of bleeding edge technology talks, methodology talks and architectual insights.

During this edition about 30 JWorks colleagues joined talks at Devoxx.
Ordina again had a very popular booth by providing attendees nachos , the venue is a cinema after all.

//TODO insert pictures of Ordina attendees and booth.

## Keynotes

### The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Diversity (Don't panic!)

Audrey Neveu gave this inspirational keynote.

This talks, following the same format at the similar titelled book, provides an chapter by chapter overview of the struggles and issues with diversity in our industry and what steps our community can take to improve it.
The key takeaway is to be at least aware of the issue and to try to be sensitive to undertones in jokes and messages towards all members of our community, especially as they might not seem harmful at first sight.

### Qualities of a Highly Effective Architect

A typical Venkat talk.
In a funny but straightforward way he explained the pitfalls, does and don'ts for architects.
He provided a 12 point guideline that all architects should adhere to.
'Prototype beats any arguments' and 'Every technical decision should have an expiration label' are just a few examples.

This talk is a definately must-see as he provides his view on how architects should behave in an organisation with the usual portion of humor. 

## Talks

### Running Kafka in Kubernetes: a practical guide

This is a talk by Katherine Stanley from IBM.
She works in the IBM Event Streams project.

This talk provides a good overview of common pitfalls with setting up Kafka on a Kubernetes cluster.
Katherine introduces all basic concepts, so following this talk is possible without a ton of Kafka and Kubernetes knowledge.
Katherine discusses how several Kubernetes constructs are used to support and enabled the usage of Kafka and Zookeeper.
Liveness and readiness probes, Statefull sets, Pod anti affinity, Persistant volumes and headless services are all discussed.
Lastly Katherine discusses the different options for running and managing a Kafka cluster on Kubernetes.
Both the IBM Events Helm charts and Strimzi are shown and discussed.
Strimzi is an operator that allows Kafka cluster to be created and managed through CRDS in Kubernetes.

### Kubernetes Faster and Easier

Ray Tsang is a developer advocate for the Google Cloud Platform.
He is a Java Champion and works on improving the usability of GCP for Java usecases.

Ray shows some tools and their usecases when developing Java applications on Kubernetes. 
Most tools are shown in a small demo. 

Discussed tools

* [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
* [Java Memory Calculator](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack-memory-calculator){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
* [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
* [k3s](https://k3s.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
* [Kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
* [Skaffold](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
* [Graceful shutdown library](https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/springboot-graceful-shutdown){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

He also provides some common pitfalls when developing Java for Kubernetes.
He refers to his talk about common [docker pitfalls](https://saturnism.me/talk/docker-tips-and-tricks/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

Finally he showed a demo of how an IntelliJ plugin when combined with Skaffold can allow a developer to debug a live running container on a Kubernetes cluster, straight from their local machine. Side note, this is super cool!

### Observing Chaos

Juraci Paixão Kröhling is a SE at RedHat working on the Kiali team and a maintainer of Jaeger Tracing.

He provides a brief overview of the basic concepts of a services mesh, it's inner workings with a sidecar and their advantages and issues.
Next, he discussed how different features of a service mesh can solve common concerns w.r.t. routing, resiliency, security, observability and distributed tracing.

The last part of the talk is an extensive demo of the four tools/technologies discussed in the talk: Jaeger, Istio, Quarkus and Kiala.
A demo service is deployed and a distributed tracing example scenario is shown and discussed.

### What happens after your startup is acquired

This was an amazing talk by Renata Tamasi, founder of Samebug and currently working at Rollbar.

During this talk, she took us through the journey of running and later-on selling her start-up to Rollbar.
She starts by showing the struggles they had to get the start-up going in Europe and what the pitfalls they uncovered during journey.
Simply put, getting a SaaS based start-up off the ground and making is succesfull in Europe is almost impossible without the founders moving to the US.
During their journey, Renata explained the different paths they tried with Samebug ranging from trying to raise funding for their start-up to finally getting aquired by Rollbar.
This is a must see talk for everyone who wants to join a start-up and it will be very familiar for anyone who was in a start-up at one point in time.

### Ressiliency and availability design patterns for the cloud

Sebastien Stormacq is a senior Technical Evangelist as AWS.

Your system should still work when a failure occurs, even if it's just in a degraded state.
Your business should not rely on a single person being available and present.

Geo redundancy is explained and how you can use availability zones (AZs) to have geo redundancy.
He also explaines a scenario where a AZ fails and a hot failover is performed using an Elastic Load Balancer.
Always spread architectures over multiple AZs or use regionless services (S3, ELB) which are multi-az by default.

Load shedding is a technique to drop all traffic once a service becomes loaded beyond a preset point of health load.
This prevents the service from being overloaded.

Shuffle sharding is a technique to reduce the blast radius for an outage by create isolated comparments in the infrastructure.

Finally Sebastian provides two very good resources: 

* [Amazon well architected](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
* [Choas engineering blog](https://medium.com/@adhorn){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

Takeaways:

* Use Availability zones to achieve Geo redundancy
* Use autoscaling mechanisms to have self-healing VMs
* Test your backups
* Split database setup, logically or functionally (read-write / sharding)
* Set and sync timeouts
* Implement backoffs for retries with Jitter
* Make sure database operations are idempotent
* Use circuit breaks to prevent overloading an already degraded system
* Implement healthchecks
* Reject traffic when load is high on the service (Load shedding and throttling)
* Apply shuffle sharding techniques to limit blast radius of outage
* Perform GameDays
* Experiment with Chaos engineering

### SSL/TLS for mortals

Maarten Mulders provides this talk for mortals.

SSL is outdated and should be not be used anymore.
Documentation can be confusing as SSL is sometimes used to discuss actually SSL and TLS setups.
Only TLS should be used as SSL has been broken multiple times.

Maarten goes on to explain the basic concepts of public and private keys.
He also explains all the mathmatics behind the RSA key creation.

This talk is ideal for people wanting to get a brief overview of how TLS works.

### Defence Against the Docker Arts

Joe Kutner works at Heroku and is a core maintainer of [Buildpacks.io](https://buildpacks.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

He starts this talk by providing a set of common pitfalls and best practises for creating Dockerfiles in rapidfire.
Multi-stage builds, combining multiple run commands into one and using proper base images for all docker builds are just a few examples.

Joe then discusses the pros and cons of [Buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} as tools for building Docker images.

Lastly, Joe explains what Buildpacks are, their origin, their usecases and what the architecture is.
The different advantages of Buildpacks are extensivly explained and the lifecyle of a typical Buildpack is shown.
Pack is discussed as an easy way to use Buildpacks for a Spring Boot application.
Joe demos the usefulness of Buildpacks with the usecase of the HeartBlead CVE.

This talk is recommended for an audience that is interested in building Docker images without having to deal with Dockerfiles.

### Flowable business processing from Kafka events

Tijs Rademakers and Joram Barrez are both employees of Flowable.

The talk starts by providing a brief overview of Flowable as a product.
They introduce the different standards that Flowable supports, BPMN, CMMN and DMN.
Tijs continious by explaining the architecture of Flowable and it's evolution.

Next, Joram explains how (Kafka) events can be used in the Engine.
He continious the talk by providing a demo of the platform using an example process.
A flow diagram of the information flow and the use of Kafka and Flowable is shown.
He also shows all code that is required to execute the demo process.

This talk provides a good starting point for Flowable, even for people who have very little to no experience with BPM engines.

### A container platform for the banking industry - why, what & how

This talk is presented by Wiebe de Roos, an CI/CD Consultant and Engineer at ABN AMRO Bank.

Wiebe starts by sketching the scale of the project and their container journey.
The different requirements are discussed and platform landscape was used.
Next, he discusses what pipelines are used to provide the end-to-end CI/CD workflow.

He continious to explain what measure they have taken to adhere to the hard audit requirements in their regulated banking environment.
Container security, compliancy, monitoring and logging and their solutions for these requirements are shown and explained.

This is an amazing talk, a definately must watch for anyone using Kubernetes in a regulated environment.

## Conclusion

One of the takeaways from this conference is that the diversity in our industry is still an issue that we surely need to tackle as a community.
Both during a keynote as in other talks, clear statements were made that our industry is still struggling to embrace diversity and provide the same opportunities to all groups of our society.
// TODO, can we add this? And if so, can we add a statement on how we help solving this in JWorks? (Looked on the Ordina website, but didn't find anything specifically)

Another interesting insight is that Kubernetes now is the defacto deployment platform for Java applications moving forward.
During the conference a lot of tools, Jib popped up a few times, and integrations with IDEs have been showcased and every talk seems to assumes that the deployment platform is Kubernetes.

Event driven talks are also in a lift.
There were quite a few talks about Kafka or talks about software that can integrate with Kafka.

Finally, the conference was a great success again.
Ordina handed out tons of nachos (about //TODO kg), every attendee has been caught up with the trends in our community and all vendors have been able to showcase their newest products.

See you next year Devoxx people!
