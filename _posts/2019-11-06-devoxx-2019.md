## The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Diversity (Don't panic!)

## Qualities of a Highly Effective Architect

A typical Venkat talk.
In a funny but straightforward way he explained the pitfalls, does and don'ts for architects.
He provided a 12 point guideline that all architects should adhere to.
'Prototype beats any arguments' and 'Every technical decision should have an expiration label' are just a few examples.

# Talks

## Running Kafka in Kubernetes: a practical guide

This is a talk by Katherine Stanley from IBM.
She works in the IBM Event Streams project.

This talk provides a good overview of common pitfalls with setting up Kafka on a Kubernetes cluster.
Katherine introduces all basic concepts, so following this talk is possible without a ton of Kafka 
and Kubernetes knowledge.

Readiness and liveness probe usage is explained for both Kafka and Zookeeper.
Consequences and fixes for incorrect setup probes are discussed.
One discussed example is that one might lose data when the readiness probe reports a healthy node although it hasn't synced properly yet.
This would cause the rolling update to take the second pod offline before the new pod has synced all data, meaning that data lose would occur. 

The usage of Statefull sets, Persistant Volumes and Persistant Volume Claims is explained and discussed.
She explains how Stafeull sets help with using the storage for each broker.

PodAntiAffinity can be used to split the Kafka and Zookeeper pods across different node. 
As the assumption in Kubernetes is that a node can go down, but the service should still remain available.

In Kubernetes a headless service should be used for the Kafka nodes.
This is required since the clients need to communicate directly with the Kafka pods.
Using a regular service would loadbalance each request, which is not desired. 

Lastly Katherine discusses the different options for running and managing a Kafka cluster on Kubernetes.
Both the IBM Events Helm charts and Strimzi are shown and discussed.
Strimzi is an operator that allows Kafka cluster to be created and managed through CRDS in Kubernetes.
