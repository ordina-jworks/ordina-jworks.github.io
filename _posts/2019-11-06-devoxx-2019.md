## Keynotes

### The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Diversity (Don't panic!)

### Qualities of a Highly Effective Architect

A typical Venkat talk.
In a funny but straightforward way he explained the pitfalls, does and don'ts for architects.
He provided a 12 point guideline that all architects should adhere to.
'Prototype beats any arguments' and 'Every technical decision should have an expiration label' are just a few examples.

## Talks

### Running Kafka in Kubernetes: a practical guide

This is a talk by Katherine Stanley from IBM.
She works in the IBM Event Streams project.

This talk provides a good overview of common pitfalls with setting up Kafka on a Kubernetes cluster.
Katherine introduces all basic concepts, so following this talk is possible without a ton of Kafka 
and Kubernetes knowledge.

Readiness and liveness probe usage is explained for both Kafka and Zookeeper.
Consequences and fixes for incorrect setup probes are discussed.
One discussed example is that one might lose data when the readiness probe reports a healthy node although it hasn't synced properly yet.
This would cause the rolling update to take the second pod offline before the new pod has synced all data, meaning that data lose would occur. 

The usage of Statefull sets, Persistant Volumes and Persistant Volume Claims is explained and discussed.
She explains how Stafeull sets help with using the storage for each broker.

PodAntiAffinity can be used to split the Kafka and Zookeeper pods across different node. 
As the assumption in Kubernetes is that a node can go down, but the service should still remain available.

In Kubernetes a headless service should be used for the Kafka nodes.
This is required since the clients need to communicate directly with the Kafka pods.
Using a regular service would loadbalance each request, which is not desired. 

Lastly Katherine discusses the different options for running and managing a Kafka cluster on Kubernetes.
Both the IBM Events Helm charts and Strimzi are shown and discussed.
Strimzi is an operator that allows Kafka cluster to be created and managed through CRDS in Kubernetes.

### Kubernetes Faster and Easier

Ray Tsang is a developer advocate for the Google Cloud Platform. 
He is a Java Champion and works on improving the usability of GCP for Java usecases. 

Testing is key for all apps and service. 
For container based testing [this](https://www.testcontainers.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} might be a good option. 

Older JDK versions aren't container aware.
Resourcse limits won't be taken into account in these older versions, causing Out-Of-Memory exceptions.
Using a recent JDK container image should be aware of the CGroups and it's memory limits.
Determining the ideal resource limits can be hard.
Ray showed a tool for determining the [appropriate limits](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack-memory-calculator){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

Ray provides a brief overview of conatainer best practices.
An overview of these best practices can found in [this talk](https://saturnism.me/talk/docker-tips-and-tricks/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

Jib is a tool to build Java container images.
It is provided as a Maven plugin.
During the talk Ray demos and explains the usage and benefits of using this tool.
It can incorporate the docker builds in the Maven lifecycles.

Furthermore, Ray shows two different ways to easily run local Kubernetes clusters.
On Linux, [k3s](https://k3s.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} can be used to start a very simple Kubernetes cluster locally. 
On Windows or Mac OS X or any system where Docker is available, [Kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} can be used.
Both of these tools will spin up a one node cluster and change your local kubeconfig to point to the new cluster.

He goes on to show a demo of the entire flow of building the image, deploying it locally and making changes to the service.
Skaffold is shown as a way to automate the developer flow of buildings and deploying it locally.
It will watch for changes to the files and rebuild automatically and redeploy the new container image.
There is a integration available for Intellj that allows the user to debug the application live on the local Kubernetes cluster (Super cool!).

Rays goes on to explain how to set resources requests and limits and why they are needed.
The usage of liveness and readiness are explained in conjuction with the lifecylce signals and graceful shutdown.
An [additional library](https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/springboot-graceful-shutdown){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} is shown for handling graceful shutdowns in Spring.

### Observing Chaos

Juraci Paixão Kröhling is a SE at RedHat working on the Kiali team and a maintainer of Jaeger Tracing.

He starts by explaining what a service mesh is and why it is useful.
The basic setup of a service mesh and it's usage of a sidecar.
Both the upsides and downsides are discussed. 

Next, some use cases are discussed: smart routing, resiliency and security.
These use cases are connected to the features a service mesh exposes.

Observability and distributed tracing are defined and some examples are provided.
The requirement to instrument code is explained and a minimal example is shown.

Mutual TLS and fault tolerance features are shown and explained in Istio.
Jaeger is introduced as a distributed tracing tool.

The last part of the talk is an extensive demo of the three tools discussed in the talk: Jaeger, Istio, Quarkus and Kiala.
A demo service is deployed and a distributed tracing example scenario is shown and discussed.
