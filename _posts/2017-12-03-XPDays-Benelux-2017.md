### The 8 Stances of a Scrum Master - Barry Overeem

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Barry Overeem" src="/img/xpdays-benelux-2017/Barry-Overeem.jpg"></span>
[Barry Overeem](https://twitter.com/barryovereem){:target="_blank"} is a freelance Scrum Master and Professional Scrum Trainer at Scrum.org. He’s an active member of the Scrum community and shares his insights and knowledge by speaking at conferences, facilitating workshops and writing blog posts.

This session about the roles of a Scrum Master started with a fun energizer. We all had to get up and do the following: Clap when Barry said 'clap', say our name when he said 'name', walk when he said 'walk' and stop walking when he said 'stop'.
Easy peasy lemon squeazy. After a minute, he switched this up. Now, when he said 'stop' we had to -start- walking and whenever he said 'walk', we had to -stop- walking. Confusing, but manageable. Until the final switcharoo.
To finish, he also switched the 'clap' and 'name' actions, so we had to clap whenever he said 'name' and say our name whenever he said 'clap'. Fun way to start the session!

The actual session starts with an overview of the 8 misunderstood stances of a Scrum Master:

* **Scrum Police:** Scrum isn't a hard set of rules to be followed. There's absolutely nothing wrong with a bit of flexibility and empathy based on the team's situation.
Time boxing for example is very important but keep an open mind when the team is having a very valuable conversation when the time box has ended.
Flexibility regarding time boxing is of course not meant to happen too often. So keep an eye out for recurring discussions to see if they need to be addressed separately.
* **Hero:** Managing and solving all problems and impediments like nobody's business! While an important task for the Scrum Master, make sure not to get too focused on being the team's impediment super hero.
* **Scribe:** "Hey John, you're taking notes again for this meeting, right? Thanks!". Do you recognize this exchange? Congratulations, you're the team's personal scribe.
This is especially to be avoided during retrospectives since this creates a false sense of ownership of the issues and actions towards the Scrum Master.
* **Admin:** The Scrum Master is the workflow master. Need to add a board in Jira? Ask the Scrum Master. Need to start a sprint in Jira? Ask the Scrum Master. Need a break and have a cigarette? Ask the Scrum Master. Oh. Wait.
* **Secretary:** The Scrum Master plans all the work in the team members' agendas. Keep up to date with everybody's holidays and toilet breaks.
* **Chairman:** While this is often the case, the Daily Scrum isn't a meeting where the team members report back to the Scrum Master. It's a meeting by and for the development team. In absense of the Scrum Master, the Daily Scrum must still happen.
* **Team Boss:** The Scrum Master is the boss of the team. He/she decides who is in and who is out. A sick day? You're fired! Buy the Scrum Master a chocolate cake? Here, have a raise!
* **Coffee Clerk:** Please do get your team members some coffee once in a while. But no, fetching coffee day in day out is not part of the Scrum Master's job description.
