### The 8 Stances of a Scrum Master - Barry Overeem

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Barry Overeem" src="/img/xpdays-benelux-2017/Barry-Overeem.jpg"></span>
[Barry Overeem](https://twitter.com/barryovereem){:target="_blank"} is a freelance Scrum Master and Professional Scrum Trainer at Scrum.org. He’s an active member of the Scrum community and shares his insights and knowledge by speaking at conferences, facilitating workshops and writing blog posts.

This session about the roles of a Scrum Master started with a fun energizer. We all had to get up and do the following: Clap when Barry said 'clap', say our name when he said 'name', walk when he said 'walk' and stop walking when he said 'stop'.
Easy peasy lemon squeazy. After a minute, he switched this up. Now, when he said 'stop' we had to -start- walking and whenever he said 'walk', we had to -stop- walking. Confusing, but manageable. Until the final switcharoo.
To finish, he also switched the 'clap' and 'name' actions, so we had to clap whenever he said 'name' and say our name whenever he said 'clap'. Fun way to start the session!

The actual session starts with an overview of the 8 misunderstood stances of a Scrum Master:

</div>

* **A Scribe:** Taking notes during Scrum events. Writing down the entire Sprint plan, daily plan,
refinement discussions and Retrospective commitments. I’ve actually experienced a customer
that expected the “Scrum Master” to act as a scribe for 4 hours per week…
* **A Secretary:** Planning all the Scrum events in everyone’s agenda. Responsible for keeping the
teams’ schedule with holidays and days off up-to-date.
* **The Scrum Police:** Rigorously following the rules of Scrum without any empathy for the
team’s current situation and context. If you’re not acting according to the Scrum Guide you’re
doing it wrong. Period.
* **The Team Boss:** The so-called “servant-leader”, but actually just the boss of the team. The
boss who hires and fires. The boss who decides if someone deserves a salary increase.
* **The Admin:** If you need a change in JIRA, TFS or any other tool: the Scrum Master is your
friend. He (or she) knows every workflow by heart.
* **The Chairman:** Every morning the team provides a status update to the chairman of the Daily
Scrum. This offers the Scrum Master the necessary information to write the daily status report
to his/her superiors.
* **A Super Hero:** It’s a bird. It’s a plane. It’s the Super Scrum Master!!! Solving all your
impediments before it actually even was an impediment. The hero is addicted to the
adrenaline of solving “problems.” It’s not about the team, it’s about increasing his status as a
hero.
* **The Coffee Clerk:** There’s nothing wrong with getting coffee for your team members. This is
very collegial. But if your main purpose during the day is providing the team with coffee…
then you’re missing the point of being a Scrum Master.
