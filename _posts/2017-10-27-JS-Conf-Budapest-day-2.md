## From JS Conf Budapest with love

This year's edition of JS Conf Budapest returned to the first venue at [Urania National Movie theater](http://akvariumklub.hu/).

> UrÃ¡nia Cinema in the middle of the city, near the party-district.
> Designed by Henrik Schmahl in the late 1890's, the interior is characterized by the ornamental motifs of the Venetian Gothic and Moor styles.
> The place is listed as the world's 3rd most beautiful cinema on Bored Panda, and many tech conferences were hosted here recently, like TEDx, and Strech Conference, because of the unique atmosphere.

JS Conf Budapest 2017 is hosted by [](https://twitter.com/) and [](https://twitter.com/).

At 10:00 the second day of the conference started.
