## From JS Conf Budapest with love

This year's edition of JS Conf Budapest returned to the first venue at [Urania National Movie theater](http://akvariumklub.hu/).

> UrÃ¡nia Cinema in the middle of the city, near the party-district.
> Designed by Henrik Schmahl in the late 1890's, the interior is characterized by the ornamental motifs of the Venetian Gothic and Moor styles.
> The place is listed as the world's 3rd most beautiful cinema on Bored Panda, and many tech conferences were hosted here recently, like TEDx, and Strech Conference, because of the unique atmosphere.

JS Conf Budapest 2017 is hosted by [](https://twitter.com/) and [](https://twitter.com/).

At 10:00 the second day of the conference started.

<blockquote class="clear"><p>
Laura Carvajali works at the Financial Times. 
She's responsible for the accessibility of their website so that even blind people are able to use it.
In her talk, she explained how to achieve this.
</p></blockquote>

Accessibility doesn't happen by accident, you have to make it happen yourself.
A good starting point is to install pa11y (with npm).
It checks your HTML and points out where you can improve.
Color contrast issues, no or bad alt text for images and no related label for input fields are very common issue pa11y reports on.
Pa11y-ci can be used to integrate it with your CI and can break the build when there are errors.

With that done, there are some extra steps that can be taken.
First, you can get an external audit to get more feedback.
They have people that test with voice control, keyboard only mode, text to speech and other tools.
Next, you could do customer research and user testing with users with various disabilities.
Another option is to learn to use the tools for people with disabilities yourself and test with them.
The first option is the most expensive one, the second one is already less expensive while the last one is the cheapest.
A MacBook for example already has a lot of tools built in for people with disabilities if you want to test yourself.
