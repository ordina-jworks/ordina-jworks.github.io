>Next week, on the 5th of October 2016, the JWorks Business Unit at Ordina will organize its yearly JOIN Event. The purpose of this event is to share knowledge between colleagues and fellow Java- and JavaScript enthousiasts. Last year, a total of 83 attendees visited Ordina Belgiumâ€™s headquarters in Mechelen to pack their heads with interesting technology facts.
This year, we hope to do better and break the 100 attendees mark with some very special speakers.

Arun has been an avid Docker user for many years and is also one of the Docker Captains, among being a Java Champion and JUG leader.
He will bring us a very informative talk about the current state of Docker and how Java Developers can get started with Docker in no time.

We're very much looking forward to this one!

> He will also talk about the product company he's working for at the moment, **Couchbase**.

He is a Google Cloud Platform Authorized Trainer & partner.

> We are currently working on a large scale migration of legacy application to the Google Cloud Platform for one of our customers so this will be very interesting for our own collegues

### 6PM - 7PM - Reactive Programming - Stephane Maldini

He is also one of the main contributors for Reactive support in the upcoming Spring 5 framework.

> Most of our developers in the JWorks Unit are using Spring (as opposed to J2EE) so this talk is gonna be **very** interesting
