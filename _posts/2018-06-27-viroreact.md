## Introduction
Augmented Reality is a very interesting space so naturally, we wanted to do something with it.
There are many frameworks available for building cross-platform AR/VR applications.
We came across ViroReact which uses React and React Native to create immersive VR and AR applications using a single codebase for Android and iOS.
This persuaded us to give it a try.
In one day, with some tweaking afterwards, we were able to create a simple app to show the status of a meeting room. 

## Basics of ViroReact

### Components
The main building blocks of a ViroReact app are the components.

#### The most important component is a Scene
The [scene](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/scenes) is the digital environment the user interacts with.
All other components live in this scene.
```xml
<ViroScene>
<ViroARScene>
```

Just like many other components, the Scene comes in two variations: `ViroScene` and `ViroARScene`.
As the name suggests `ViroARScene` is used for Augmented Reality applications
while the `ViroScene` is meant for Virtual Reality.

A [ViroSceneNavigator](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/scene-navigation) is used to navigate between these scenes.
```xml
<ViroSceneNavigator>
<ViroARSceneNavigator>
```
The SceneNavigator holds a stack of scenes to enable simple transitions from one scene to the next or previous scene.

#### These scenes can be populated with all kinds of components
For example a [ViroText](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/virotext2).
```xml
<ViroText
	text="Hello World"
	position={[0,0,-5]}
	color="#ff0000"
	width={2} height={2}
	style={{fontFamily:"Arial", fontSize:20}}/>
```

Or perhaps a [ViroBox](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/virobox), a [ViroQuad](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/viroquad) or a [ViroSphere](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/virosphere).  
These components can be modified by setting their properties.
One of the most important properties is the position.
It takes an array of three numbers as the x, y and z coordinates. 

#### There are also more specialised components
Like a [Viro3DObject](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/viro3dobject) which lets you include custom made 3D objects in your scene.

```xml
<Viro3DObject
	source={require("./res/spaceship.obj")} type="OBJ"
	resources={[require('./res/spaceship.mtl'),
		require('./res/texture1.jpg')]}
	position={[1, 3, -5]} scale={[2, 2, 2]}
	rotation={[45, 0, 0]}
	transformBehaviors={["billboard"]}/>
```
These 3D objects can be created in your favourite 3D modelling tools.
ViroReact supports OBJ or VRX (converted from FBX) formats.
The billboard transform behaviour is an interesting feature to make sure the object is always facing the user.

A [Viro360Image](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/viro360image) can be set as the background of a scene.
 
A [ViroPortal](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/viroportal) lets the user take a peek into a different scene.
It basically is a window to another world.
The Viro3DObject included in it acts like the window frame.

A [ViroARImageMarker](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/viroarimagemarker) reacts when one of the ViroARTrackingTargets is scanned.
It will show all the components inside the `ViroARImageMarker` tag.
We have used this in our little app, more on that [below](#demo-application).

```xml
<ViroARImageMarker target={"targetOne"}>
    <ViroBox position={[0, 0.25, 0]} scale={[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]} />
</ViroARImageMarker>
```

```javascript
ViroARTrackingTargets.createTargets({
  "targetOne" : {
	source : require('./res/targetOne.jpg'),
	orientation : "Up",
	physicalWidth : 0.1 // real world width in meters
  },
});
```

#### We wouldn't see anything without eyes and light
The [Camera](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/camera) component is our eyes.
```xml
<ViroCamera position={[0, 0, 0]} rotation={[45, 0, 0]) active={true} />
```
A default camera is provided at the origin `position={[0, 0, 0]}`.
The camera always looks in the negative Z direction.
So if you want an object to be visible as soon as the scene loads up, 
make sure to set its position with a negative Z value `position={[0, 0, -5]}`. 
If the object would have a positive Z value it would be placed behind you when you load up the scene.
There is also a `ViroOrbitCamera` where the camera orbits around a certain position, always keeping it in view.

[Lights](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/3d-scene-lighting) are very important components in a scene.
Without any light, the user wouldn't see anything.
Luckily a default light is provided when none is defined.
We didn't need lights in our setup but if you want a more realistic or visually stunning experience, 
I highly recommend you to look into the different lights in the [documentation](https://docs.viromedia.com/v2.6.1/docs/3d-scene-lighting).  
There are four lighting models: Phong, Blinn, Lambert and Constant.  
These are the algorithms that calculate what your objects will look like when influenced by light.
By default, elements use the Constant lighting model, which means lights will be ignored and the object will show its full color.  
ViroReact supports four types of light.

The [ViroAmbientLight](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/viroambientlight) is the simplest light.
```xml
<ViroAmbientLight color="#ffffff"/>
```
It lights up all the objects in the scene equally from every direction.
Only the color needs to be set.

A [ViroOmniLight](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/viroomnilight) is comparable to a light bulb.
```xml
<ViroOmniLight
    color="#ffffff"
    attenuationStartDistance={2}
    attenuationEndDistance={6}
    position={[0,-5,5]}
 />
```
The light originates from a specified position and moves in all directions.
The light slowly fades out if the distance is between 2 and 6, set in the attenuation properties.

A [ViroSpotLight](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/virospotlight1) is comparable to a flashlight.
```xml
<ViroSpotLight
    color="#ffffff"
    attenuationStartDistance={2}
    attenuationEndDistance={6}
    position={[0, -5, 5]}
    direction={[0 -1, 0]}
    innerAngle={0}
    outerAngle={45}
 />
```
The light originates from a single point and shines in a cone.
The direction and angle of the cone can be set as well as the attenuation start and end distances.
Some other properties are available to create the shadows you want.

The last type of light is the [ViroDirectionalLight](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/virodirectionallight-1).
```xml
<ViroDirectionalLight
    color="#ffffff"
    direction={[0, -1, 0]}
 />
```
The sun would be the prime example of a ViroDirectionalLight.
It shines over the whole scene in a specific direction.

#### To make these objects look good we need Materials
[Materials](http://viro.readme.io/docs/3d-scene-lighting) are used to place texture images on 3d objects.
They can make a long box look like a brick wall or a sphere look like our planet.
```javascript
ViroMaterials.createMaterials({
  earth: {
	shininess: 2.0,
	lightingModel: "Lambert",
	diffuseTexture: require('./res/earth_texture.jpg'),
  }
});
```
There are many properties available for materials.
Discussing all of these is outside the scope of this article.
The diffuseColor and diffuseTexture are the main color and texture of the material.
These can be placed on basic 3D objects like ViroBox, ViroQuad and ViroSphere.
Complex Viro3DObjects can have multiple materials.

#### Move them around with Animations 
Our scenes are still lacking motion.
That's where [animations](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/animation) come in handy. 

```javascript
ViroAnimations.registerAnimations({
	animateImage:{properties:{scaleX:1.0, scaleY:0.6},
				  easing:"Bounce", duration: 5000}});
```
```xml
<ViroImage source={require('./res/myimage.jpg')}
		   position={[0, -1, -2]}
		   animation={{name:'animateImage', run:true}}/>
```
Animations change the numerical value of properties over time.
Typically this is used for the position and scale properties but it can just as well be used for color values or other numerical values.
There are five easing types: Linear, EaseIn, EaseOut, EaseInEaseOut and Bounce.
These represent how the values change over time.

#### Control the scene with a ViroController 
With all of the above, we can create an awesome scene but we can't interact with it yet. 
The [ViroController](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/virocontroller) provides us the ability to interact with our scene. 
```xml
<ViroController 
reticleVisibility={true} 
controllerVisibility={true} 
onClick={this._onClickListenerForAllEvents} /> 
```
With the reticle (the blue circle in the middle of the view) the user can select and point to objects and call the function in the onClick property.
It's also possible to use other events like onHover, onTouch, onSwipe, onPinch, onScroll, etc...
These events are very useful for UI.

#### There are many more fun components
Apart from the ones we mentioned here, there are many more fun components to include [video](http://viro.readme.io/docs/video), [sound](http://viro.readme.io/docs/audio) and [particles](http://viro.readme.io/docs/particle-effects) in your scene.
They follow the same principles but each have their own properties.
This being built on React Native we can also declare our own components of course!

```javascript
export default class CustomComponent extends Component {
	static propTypes = {customProperty: PropTypes.number}

    constructor() {super() ;}

	render() {return (
		<ViroText text={this.props.customProperty}> );}
	}

```

```xml
<CustomComponent customProperty={42}>
```
Just extend from Component, define your properties in propTypes and use it in your scenes.
In our demo application, we used this to create our scene but you can create small reusable components too of course!

## Demo application
Before you can build a ViroReact application you need to [request an API key from ViroMedia](https://viromedia.com/signup).
This should not take more than a few minutes.

For our demo application, we decided to use meeting rooms as a use case.
Since ViroReact is advertised as a framework for rapidly building AR / VR applications, we wanted to put this statement to the test and try to create an application in one day with no knowledge of the framework at all.

### Use Case: Meeting room status viewer

<a href="{{ '/img/2018-06-26-viroreact/app-scan.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" data-lightbox="app-scan" data-title="meeting-room-viewer-app-foto">
    <img alt="stack" src="{{ '/img/2018-06-26-viroreact/mr-door.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto; max-width: 500px;">
</a>

Sometimes people want to have a quick meeting or Skype call. 
They might be standing or passing by a meeting room, 
and have the ability to immediately check if the meeting room is available for the next 30 minutes. 

We created an application where the user can view the status of a meeting room in Augmented Reality by scanning the room name/picture.

We used [Image Recognition in ViroReact](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/ar-image-recognition) to achieve this.

Aside from the Image Recognition, we were also curious how ViroReact handles
- HTTP requests
- UI Updates
- User interaction

Eventually, I created three applications:
- A backend application for holding meeting room state (NestJS)
- A client application for changing the state of a meeting room (Ionic PWA)
- A client application for viewing the state of a meeting room (ViroReact)

For this blogpost, I will only discuss how we created the ViroReact application.

### The AR Meeting room viewer (ViroReact)

<a href="{{ '/img/2018-06-26-viroreact/app-scan.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" data-lightbox="app-scan" data-title="meeting-room-viewer-app-foto">
    <img alt="stack" src="{{ '/img/2018-06-26-viroreact/app-scan.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto; max-width: 500px;">
</a>

ViroReact is built on top of React, so basic knowledge of React is necessary. 
To get started, you can follow this great free beginner guide by Kent C. Dodds at egghead.io 
[The beginner's guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react.)


#### Step 1: Project setup
We began by following the Official [Quick Start guide from ViroMedia](https://docs.viromedia.com/v2.7.3/docs/quick-start).

Using the [react-viro CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-viro), we generated a ViroSample project.

```bash
react-viro init ARMeetingRoomViewer
``` 

#### Step 2: Create an AR scene for viewing the status of a meeting room.
To be able to scan the meeting room we needed a picture of the meeting room nameplate, 
this will act as the marker to scan the meeting room information.

<a href="{{ '/img/2018-06-26-viroreact/m07-image-marker.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" data-lightbox="m07" data-title="meeting-room-viewer-app-foto">
    <img alt="stack" src="{{ '/img/2018-06-26-viroreact/m07-image-marker.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto; max-width: 300px;">
</a>

I placed the marker image inside of the `**/js/res**` folder.

Because the file extension was in capital letters (.JPG), 
I had to configure this extension in the `rn-cli.config.js` file inside of the root folder.

```javascript
  getAssetExts() {
    return ["obj", "mtl", "JPG", "vrx", "hdr"];
  },
```

Next, I created the actual scene in a file called **markerscene.js** in the **/js/** folder.

To be able to scan the image marker, we need two important APIs:
- [ViroARTrackingTargets](https://docs.viromedia.com/v2.7.3/docs/viroartrackingtargets)
- [ViroARImageMarker](https://docs.viromedia.com/v2.7.3/docs/viroarimagemarker) component

When the scene initialises we need to setup the Tracking Target(our image marker)
**mr7** refers to a meeting room name.

We call this method inside of the constructor.

```javascript
    setMarker() {
        ViroARTrackingTargets.createTargets({
            "mr7": {
                source: require('./res/mr7.JPG'),
                orientation: "Up",
                physicalWidth: 1
            },
        });
    }
```

Then we need to define what to render. 
The root component will be an AR Scene:

```xml
 <ViroARScene onAnchorFound={this._getInfo}
              onClick={this._getInfo}>
  ...
 </ViroARScene>
```

We bind two events on the ViroARScene component, onAnchorFound and onClick. 
Every time one of these events occurs, we want to fetch the latest meeting room state.

`onAnchorFound` gets called when the Image Marker has been detected.

```javascript
getInfo() {
    fetch('https://rooms.meeting/rm7')
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((res) => {
            const isTrueSet = (res.isAvailable === 'true');
            this.setState({
                isAvailable: isTrueSet,
                nextMeeting: isTrueSet ? `Next meeting: ${res.nextMeeting}h` : `Free @ ${res.nextMeeting}h`,
                text: isTrueSet ? `Available` : 'Not Available'
            })
        })
        .catch((error) => {
            console.error(error);
        });
}
```

Inside the scene, we want to display the meeting room data when the Image Marker is scanned.
We need to use the ViroReact ImageMarker component for this.

```xml
<ViroARImageMarker target={"mr7"}>
    <ViroFlexView style={this.state.isAvailable ? styles.containerAvail : styles.containerNotAvail}
                  width={3}
                  height={3}
                  position={[0, 0, 1.25]}
                  rotation={[-100, 0, 0]}>
        <ViroText text={this.state.text}
                  width={2}
                  height={2}
                  style={styles.text}/>
        <ViroText text={this.state.nextMeeting}
                  position={[0, -1, 0]}
                  width={2.5}
                  height={2}
                  style={styles.nextMeeting}/>
    </ViroFlexView>
</ViroARImageMarker>
```

The **ViroARImageMarker** component has a target "mr7" assigned.
This refers to the **ViroARTrackingTarget** we defined in the **setMarker()** method above.

When the target is successfully scanned, all the content of the ViroARImageMarker component will be rendered.
In our case, two TextViews positioned with a FlexView.

We bind the data we fetched from in our `getInfo()` method to the ViroText and ViroFlexView components.

And these are the styles we defined for the ViroText and ViroFlexView.

```javascript
var styles = StyleSheet.create({
    text: {
        fontFamily: 'Arial',
        fontSize: 32,
        flex: .5,
        color: '#FFFFFF'
    },
    nextMeeting: {
        fontFamily: 'Arial',
        fontSize: 32,
        flex: .5,
        color: '#FFFFFF'
    },
    containerAvail: {
        flexDirection: 'column',
        backgroundColor: "#E98300",
        padding: .2,
    },
    containerNotAvail: {
        flexDirection: 'column',
        backgroundColor: "#e91530",
        padding: .2,
    }
});
```

Our final scene

```javascript
'use strict';

import React, {Component} from 'react';

import {StyleSheet} from 'react-native';

import {
    ViroARScene,
    ViroText,
    ViroConstants,
    ViroARTrackingTargets,
    ViroARImageMarker,
    ViroFlexView
} from 'react-viro';

export default class MarkerScene extends Component {

    constructor() {
        super();

        // Set initial state here
        this.state = {
            text: "Initializing AR...",
            nextMeeting: "",
            isAvailable: true
        };

        this.setMarker();
        this._getInfo = this._getInfo.bind(this);
    }

    setMarker() {
        ViroARTrackingTargets.createTargets({
            "mr7": {
                source: require('./res/mr7.JPG'),
                orientation: "Up",
                physicalWidth: 1
            },
        });
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <ViroARScene onAnchorFound={this._getInfo}
                         onClick={this._getInfo}>
                <ViroARImageMarker target={"mr7"}>
                    <ViroFlexView style={this.state.isAvailable ? styles.containerAvail : styles.containerNotAvail}
                                  width={3}
                                  height={3}
                                  position={[0, 0, 1.25]}
                                  rotation={[-100, 0, 0]}>
                        <ViroText text={this.state.text}
                                  width={2}
                                  height={2}
                                  style={styles.text}/>
                        <ViroText text={this.state.nextMeeting}
                                  position={[0, -1, 0]}
                                  width={2.5}
                                  height={2}
                                  style={styles.nextMeeting}/>
                    </ViroFlexView>
                </ViroARImageMarker>
            </ViroARScene>
        );
    }

    _getInfo() {
        fetch('https://rooms.meeting/rm7')
            .then((response) => response.json())
            .then((res) => {
                const isTrueSet = (res.isAvailable === 'true');
                this.setState({
                    isAvailable: isTrueSet,
                    nextMeeting: isTrueSet ? `Next meeting: ${res.nextMeeting}h` : `Free @ ${res.nextMeeting}h`,
                    text: isTrueSet ? `Available` : 'Not Available'
                })
            })
            .catch((error) => {
                console.error(error);
            });
    }
}

var styles = StyleSheet.create({
    text: {
        fontFamily: 'Arial',
        fontSize: 32,
        flex: .5,
        color: '#FFFFFF'
    },
    nextMeeting: {
        fontFamily: 'Arial',
        fontSize: 32,
        flex: .5,
        color: '#FFFFFF'
    },
    containerAvail: {
        flexDirection: 'column',
        backgroundColor: "#E98300",
        padding: .2,
    },
    containerNotAvail: {
        flexDirection: 'column',
        backgroundColor: "#e91530",
        padding: .2,
    }
});

module.exports = MarkerScene;
```

#### Step 3: Load your marker scene on application startup

Now that we have our scene, we can load it on start-up.
In the root folder you can find the `app.js` file.
Here we can define which scene to load when starting up the application.

Assign your API key from ViroMedia.

```javascript
const sharedProps = {
    apiKey: "6E2805CC-xxxx-4Ex0-8xx0-02xxxxxxx",
};
```

Import your marker scene.

```javascript
const MarkerScene = require('./js/MarkerScene');
```

Render your AR Scene.

Final result:

```javascript
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {ViroARSceneNavigator} from 'react-viro';

const sharedProps = {
    apiKey: "6E2805CC-xxxx-4Ex0-8xx0-02xxxxxxx",
};

const MarkerScene = require('./js/MarkerScene');

export default class ViroSample extends Component {
    constructor() {
        super();

        this.state = {
            sharedProps: sharedProps
        };

        this._getARNavigator = this._getARNavigator.bind(this);
    }

    render() {
        return this._getARNavigator();
    }

## Lessons learned and conclusion
Without prior knowledge it was a bit challenging for us to get our development environment set up correctly.
We had a lot of issues with debugging and cached builds. 
When we had issues, it was hard to tell if the problem was with React Native or ViroReact.

Debugging was a big challenge for us and the react native development tools don't seem to work well with ViroReact.
The documentation is quite expansive but it was not always up-to-date.

But aside from that, once we were aware of which parts of the dev tools that worked and which ones that didn't, we were able to quickly build an AR application.
