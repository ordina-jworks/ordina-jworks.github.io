## Introduction

In this series of blogposts we are going to take a deeper look into home automation.
Home automation is the wonderful art of automating your home so it becomes easier to do certain tasks.
It is a very wide field where there are many available options, platforms and devices.
If you are willing to get creative almost everything can be automated!

In this first blogpost we'll present some of the platforms that are available and some of the pros & cons of each one.
To close of this blogpost we'll start by looking in to Apple's Homekit and by extension HomeBridge.

## Different platforms

In the world of home automation there are many ways to automate stuff.
We will be focussing on either cloud-enabled platforms or those that you can run on premise.
The hardware vender based platforms (e.g.: niko) will not be included!

The platforms can be split up into two main parts:

- Cloud enabled, mainly from manufactures and larger phone companies
- On premise platforms (that do not require internet/cloud access)

Security is a very important aspect in the home automation world!
The best way one would go about to automating one's home would be completely independent from any cloud based services/APIs
Internet access can be intermittent, cloud based API's can be down or event be shut down permanently.
Even worse, accounts could be breached giving unknown third parties access to your home's devices!

However, most people already have some smart devices and most of these have their own app, so ditching any cloud based systems is going to be a lot harder/more expensive.
As with any online service please, for the love of god, use strong unique password for each different service and enable multi factor authentication wherever possible!
Using all these different apps can be very cumbersome, using app A to turn on the lights, using app B to turn on the TV, using app C to change the thermostat, you get the picture.
Some of these smart devices support home automation platforms, some do not.
As we will see later on, even those that do not support a home automation platform out of the box can mostly be made to do so!

The platforms:

- Cloud enabled (more well known):
  - TODO
- On premise solutions (lesser known, but safer):
