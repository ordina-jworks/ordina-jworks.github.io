Our first blogpost about the eXperienceAgile conference (TODO insert link how?) covered 4 interesting talks.  
However, those were not the only talks so this post will dive deeper into some of the other talks.

## Leadership in a scaling agile environment, by Leonoor Koomen
Another great talk from the eXperience Agile conference came from [Leonoor Koomen](https://twitter.com/agileonoor){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.  
She talked about how leadership works in an agile environment.

Why do companies want to start working in an agile manner?  
It could be these 3 very important reasons:
- It **reduces the time to market / volume**. A product can be released much faster.
- It **breaks down silos**. People need to work together and share knowledge.
- It **increases engagement** from the people working in the company.

But very often, it's more because **Agile is in fashion and because of the myth that agile will bring twice as much in half the time**.

When you read the above, it's no surprise that agile projects often fail, as shown below.

See the third reason, with 38%? Those projects fail because management doesn't support them.  
So leadership is very important in an agile environment!

Leaders should:
- Bring a compelling why! Why do we do this project? What do we hope to achieve?  Why does the company exist?

- Bring focus, have a clarity on what needs to be done, a certain direction, with measurable goals!

- Break silos, give the example. Make teams work together.

- Be accessible, be open for questions, criticism.

So leadership is very important and needs to inspire the various teams. Spotify is a big name and is used as an example for many companies. 
But Leonoor said:
> I hate to break it to you, but you are NOT spotify

While Spotify can be used for ideas, you probably have different dependencies, stakeholders, situational problems and so on.  
It's thus very important to come up with a plan to scale.  
How are you going to grow and handle problems?  
Transparency is essential, but gets more difficult when you scale.

While growing, how are you going to handle the measurement of progress?  
The most important measurement of progress is… **a working product**. 


So stop asking for progress reports! Rather, create an environment for autonomy and alignment.  
Give the teams autonomy to create the solution, while still providing the vision and alignment. Tell them what to do, but let them figure out the solution. 

The image below describes it perfectly.

The agile transformation is a challenge, but there's hopeful news.  
It's a long journey, but it is possible to achieve.
