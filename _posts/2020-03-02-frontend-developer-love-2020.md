# Introduction

The Frontend Developer Love conference day was the first of 3 conference days that I was visiting in Amsterdam.
While the other 2 days were focussed on VueJS, the first day was a day filled with more generic frontend topics.
These topics ranged from Webpack, serverless to micro-interactions and more inspirational talks.

# How thinking small is changing software development big time, by [Sander Hoogendoorn](https://twitter.com/aahogendoorn){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
These days we developers face mainly two challenges: the speed at which we have to deliver results and the legacy code that we must handle.
With the constant changing technology landscape, we can expect that software will not survive for 1000 years.
Regularly adapting and delivering is a key component of delivering quality software.
Sander talked about his current and previous experiences in the volatile world of software development.
In the end, it all boils down to trying to release as fast, as often and as small as you can.

# How to pack your Webpack, by [Johannes Ewald](https://twitter.com/jhnns){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
In this talk, Johannes explained more what Webpack is and how you can define your own Webpack config.
While most frontend developers use CLIs these days, a lot can be learned from actually writing a Webpack config so that you know what your favorite CLI is generating.
With the latest Webpack we now have TypeScript support in our Webpack config file.

# Serverless gives you wings, by [Yan Cui](https://twitter.com/theburningmonk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
These days we can expect that we will have users of our web applications that are distributed around the world and will use our web app 24/7.

# Modern solutions for e2e testing, by Anastasiia Dragich
During her talk, Anastasiia gave an overview of all current end-to-end testing frameworks.
While Selenium can be considered as being Genesis, we have seen a steady rise of different e2e frameworks.
If you're looking for an all-in-one solution, Cypress is the obvious choice.
But we have some other options although they might not be all-in-one solutions.
Puppeteer for example is a quicker alternative as its only task is to control a browser so you can add your own testrunner like `jest`.
But while Puppeteer is a valid choice, there is a new kid on the block called PlayWright.
PlayWright is built by the same Puppeteer people who now work for Microsoft.

# Practical a11y for web apps, by Bob Bijvoet
Even before you start writing a11y specific HTML such as aria-labels, we can take certain tips into consideration to make our web apps more accessible.

# Micro-interactions with React Spring, by [Emma Bostian](https://twitter.com/EmmaBostian){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
Micro-interactions are important in your web app as they have a lot of added value.

* They enforce perceived performance
* They illustrate a state change
* They draw attention to something
* They inform the user about the status of a task
* They build habits
* They delight our users
