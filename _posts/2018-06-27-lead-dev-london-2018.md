# London, baby!

For the forth year in a row [White October Events](https://www.whiteoctoberevents.co.uk/) and [Meri Williams](https://twitter.com/Geek_Manager) organised [The Lead Developer](https://theleaddeveloper.com/), a two day conference covering topics from leadership to recruitment and team dynamics, mixed with some technical talks. 
This year JWorks travelled to the [Barbican Centre](https://www.barbican.org.uk/) in London to attend this amazing and inspirational conference for the very first time, and returned home energized and full with ideas!

> But you also need to be a good team leader, be commercially astute, and stay on top of all the tech developments and trends coming over the horizon. 
> With a balance of content across team, tools and tech, The Lead Developer conference is designed with the complexities of the job in mind.

In this blogpost we will cover some of the talks that are mainly focused on personal development of a team lead.

## First steps as a lead by [Dan Persa](https://twitter.com/danpersa){:target="_blank"}

Dan started off with the question "Why become a lead in the first place?".
According to him, dealing with people problems is much more interesting than dealing with computers, but each company interprets this is a slightly different way. 
Some call it "tech lead", others call it "people manager", but in either case it is your job to understand what the role is all about and check that it mets your expectations because getting into leadership is not trivial.
Becoming a lead is not a natural evolution for a developer. 
It's career switch and not a promotion because a different skillset is required.
The Don't-Repeat-Yourself principle which is a key principle for each software developer, does not apply when working with people. 
As a lead, you need to communicate it over and over again. 
It will feel like you're just repeating yourself and you're boring people, but it's reassuring just to know that the goal hasn't changed.
Reptition is key.
