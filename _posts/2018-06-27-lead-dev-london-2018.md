## London, baby!

For the fourth year in a row [White October Events](https://www.whiteoctoberevents.co.uk/) and [Meri Williams](https://twitter.com/Geek_Manager) organised [The Lead Developer](https://theleaddeveloper.com/), a two day conference covering topics from leadership to recruitment and team dynamics, mixed with some technical talks. 
This year Ordina JWorks travelled to the [Barbican Centre](https://www.barbican.org.uk/) in London to attend this amazing and inspirational conference for the very first time, and returned home energized and full with ideas!

> But you also need to be a good team leader, be commercially astute, and stay on top of all the tech developments and trends coming over the horizon. 
> With a balance of content across team, tools and tech, The Lead Developer conference is designed with the complexities of the job in mind.

In this blogpost we will summerize some of the talks that are mainly focused on personal development of a team lead.

## 'First steps as a lead' by [Dan Persa](https://twitter.com/danpersa){:target="_blank"}

Why become a lead in the first place?
According to Dan Persa dealing with people problems is much more interesting than dealing with computers, but each company interprets this in a slightly different way. 
Some call it "tech lead", others call it "people manager", but in either case it is your job to understand what the role is all about and check that it fits your expectations.
Becoming a lead is not a natural evolution for a developer. 
It's a career switch and not a promotion because a different skillset is required.
The Don't-Repeat-Yourself principle which is a key principle for each software developer does not apply when working with people. 
Communicate things over and over again.
Repetition is key.

Getting into leadership is not trivial, so ask people around you for help. How do you learn these leadership skills very fast? 
- Shadow a mentor to ensure a smooth transition and not feeling lost
- Don't just read books, but put them in practice as well
- Reflect and remember good and not so good behaviour from your former leads.

As a lead you need to create an open and safe environment with mutual trust.
But how you do earn the trust and respect of your team?
- Open yourself up to be vulnerable
- Have regular one-to-one's
- Be transparent in decision-making, especially around performance evaluations
- The best solutions to problems come from the team, let them take ownership of the problem
- Create a feedback culture: give feedback as close as possible to the moment in time where the action which generated the need to provide feedback happened, decouple development feedback from performance evaluations, and organise health checks meetings
- Celebrate successes!

## 'Building sustainable teams to handle uncertainty' by [Jenny Duckett](https://twitter.com/jenny_duckett)

**What can disrupt a team?**

Change is often a good thing because we frequently make deliberate changes about how we're working in our team but there's often uncertainty involved. 
- People can feel unvalued, leave and join. The dynamics of personalities and opinions change whenever people change.
- It can be hard for teams to make decisions and handle roadmaps while senior leaders move. Revisiting decisions that you thought you'd settled and making progress can be hard.
- Shifting wider priorities can make a team feel frustrated and disempowered. 
- Re-organising teams out of existence can make people feel undervalued as individuals.
- Even things like desk moves can have a significant impact on people. More about this on [Lara Hogan's blogpost](https://larahogan.me/blog/desk-moves/){:target="_blank"}.

Putting people through these things more than occasionally, will result in a retention problem.
The way changes make people feel is at least as important as the change itself.
Emotions are critical.

**What can you do to prepare?**

First of all, work on yourself so you can sustain through these disruptive changes and be able to better support your team as a result.
You don't need to do it all yourself, let go of details, give people your trust and assume positive intent. Set yourself up to lead sustainably.

Make your team's work ownable by stopping to split efforts and starting to define a single and clear goal. 
Communicate this goal over and over again.
It will feel like you're just repeating yourself and you're boring people, but it's reassuring just to know that the goal hasn't changed.
Give your team the background they need for each piece of work by adding context to user stories, organizing story kickoffs and running workshops.

Empower your team to take ownership by embracing opportunities for positive change.
Also become great at integrating new people by assigning them a mentor. 
Let them improve your onboarding guide and technical documentation.
Make it clear that you value learning as part of everyday work, recognise that everyone is always learning.
Share understanding of your work in the team, the whole context is important.
This can be done by write good commit messages (also the why not just the what), but also by documenting decisions and the reasons for it, and keeping your documentation up to date.
Taking ownership helps people handle change.

Support and grow individuals. Use every piece of work to help someone grow and start with individual needs.
Effective delegation can be accomplished by being clear and explicit, explain what's happening and why.
Also set the scope and boundaries, what's the problem that they're trying to solve, who's involved and when should they bring questions to you.
Grow the next generation of leaders by teaching people to do your job and make yourself dispendable. 

Show your team where they fit into the wider organisation and how they relate to its goals.
A wider view helps people adapt when things change.
Don't over-insulate your team because when something gets through your shield, it will be very disruptive.
Grow people for a resilient team and organisation, and encourage your team to show off their work, to be proud of it.

Make sure that your manager understands how much work it takes from everyone to build a team that works well and the time it takes to become familiar with the domain they're working in.
Ask them for support to build a sustainable team and show why all your team's work matters.
Good communication about change is vital.
