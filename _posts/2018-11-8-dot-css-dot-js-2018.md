## Paris!
This year for the first time Ordina JWorks travelled to Paris to attend a two day conference on CSS and JS, more exactly dotCSS and dotJS which is part of the dotConfernces. dotConferences is a series of developer events in Paris that started in 2012. 

In this blogpost we go quickly over the different talks, all the talks can be found on the [YouYube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/dotconferences){:target="_blank"} of the dotConferences.


## Wireless conference
All the dotConferences are wireless-less conferences. This means they don't foresee any WiFi in the building and ask to not use laptops in the audience. They foresaw a different area where you could use your laptop and had electricity for your laptop.
