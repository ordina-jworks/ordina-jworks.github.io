## Paris!
This year for the first time Ordina JWorks travelled to Paris to attend a two day conference on CSS and JS, more exactly dotCSS and dotJS which are part of the dotConfernces. dotConferences is a series of developer events in Paris that started in 2012. 

In this blogpost we go quickly over the different talks, all the talks can be found on the [YouYube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/dotconferences){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} of the dotConferences.


## Wireless conference
All the dotConferences are wireless-less conferences. This means they don't foresee any WiFi in the building and ask to not use laptops in the audience. They foresaw a different area where you could use your laptop and had electricity for your laptop.

### 'Breaking the norm with creative CSS' by [Aga Naplocha](https://twitter.com/aganaplocha){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

The last presentation of the dotCSS conference was about using other inspirations and tools to build webpages. Aga made a bold remark that most of the websites out there have the same structure and even look and feel the same. With her talk she wanted to encourage developers to try and use other CSS Properties for building and designing websites. The three CSS properties she mentioned were clipping, masking and shape outside (all in combination with SVG). She showed each property with a clear example and discussed the differences between them. She also mentioned the compatibility of each property in the different browsers. 

Saying that most of the websites have the same look and feel is a bold statement but after you look around for a while you notice that she actually has a point. Most of the websites are using frameworks that give you a uniform, recognizable look and feel but are also really easy to use. With the properties she mentioned you can certainly build a beautiful, well-designed website but it would take more time to make sure you have a responsive website that has the same look and feel over the different browsers and devices.

### 'Learning to Love Type Systems' by [Lauren Tan](https://twitter.com/sugarpirate_){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

Since the introduction of TypeScript in 2012, web development has consistently looked more towards building software with the use of static typing. Lauren discussed why we should embrace the use of optional static typing that TypeScript provides. By using types, we add more constraints to our code and how other developers can use our code. Thus this decreases the amount of possible bugs during the development phases of a project. According to Lauren, types are mathematical propositions on how a program should work and the written code that complies to the types is a proof of the type system.

Lauren explained that while using types we should be as strict as possible. The lower cardinality we have in our types, the less bugs will occur as we limit the possible inputs to our functions. With TypeScript it's convenient to use a type such as *any* but we're better of avoiding using the *any* type. By consistently being as strict as possible in our type usage, we facilitate better integration between different developers and teams. This is definitely true stricter typing helps with defining the limits of your code while also documenting your code indirectly.

### 'Choosing Your JavaScript Framework' by [John Papa](https://twitter.com/john_papa){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

With all the current JavaScript frameworks out there it's hard to pick one to work with. During [his talk](https://www.dotconferences.com/2018/11/john-papa-choosing-your-javascript-framework){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, 
John Papa took a closer look to the three most popular frameworks at the moment: Angular, React and Vue.

When choosing the framework for your project you could ask yourself questions like _"Does it have all the features that I need?"_, 
_"What about the documentation?"_, _"Is it backed by a strong community?"_ or _"How fast is the framework?"_.
In this case all three frameworks would apply. But they all have a different way to work with components, lazy loading, state management and other stuff.  
Take for example the language it's written in. With Angular comes TypeScript, but React and Vue are by default JavaScript. 
Do you fancy TypeScript but you don't like to work with Angular? No issue, you can perfectly use TypeScript in React and Vue.

They all are perfect for building successful applications and you can go on for hours on which one is the best.
But in the end it comes down to one question: _"How does the framework make you feel when you use it?"_.  
The only way to find out is by __trying each one__. That's why John Papa created a Tour of Heroes project for each framework.

Do you wanna know which one he choose? Well, he did not want to reveal that during the talk...
