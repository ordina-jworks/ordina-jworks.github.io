## Paris!
This year for the first time Ordina JWorks travelled to Paris to attend a two day conference on CSS and JS, more exactly dotCSS and dotJS which are part of the dotConfernces. dotConferences is a series of developer events in Paris that started in 2012. 

In this blogpost we go quickly over the different talks, all the talks can be found on the [YouYube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/dotconferences){:target="_blank"} of the dotConferences.


## Wireless conference
All the dotConferences are wireless-less conferences. This means they don't foresee any WiFi in the building and ask to not use laptops in the audience. They foresaw a different area where you could use your laptop and had electricity for your laptop.

### 'Breaking the norm with creative CSS' by [Aga Naplocha](https://twitter.com/aganaplocha){:target="_blank"}

The last presentation of the dotCSS conference was about using other inspirations and tools to build webpages. Aga made a bold remark that most of the websites out there have the same structure and even look and feel the same. With her talk she wanted to encourage developers to try and use other CSS Properties for building and designing websites. The three CSS properties she mentioned were clipping, masking and shape outside (all in combination with SVG). She showed each property with a clear example and discussed the differences between them. She also mentioned the compatibility of each property in the different browsers. 

Saying that most of the websites have the same look and feel is a bold statement but after you look around for a while you notice that she actually has a point. Most of the websites are using frameworks that give you a uniform, recognizable look and feel but are also really easy to use. With the properties she mentioned you can certainly build a beautiful, well-designed website but it would take more time to make sure you have a responsive website that has the same look and feel over the different browsers and devices.

### 'Learning to Love Type Systems' by [Lauren Tan](https://twitter.com/sugarpirate_){:target="_blank"}

Since the introduction of TypeScript in 2012, web development has consistently looked more towards building software with the use of static typing. Lauren discussed why we should embrace the use of optional static typing that TypeScript provides. By using types, we add more constraints to our code and how other developers can use our code. Thus this decreases the amount of possible bugs during the development phases of a project. According to Lauren, types are mathematical propositions on how a program should work and the written code that complies to the types is a proof of the type system.

Lauren explained that while using types we should be as strict as possible. The lower cardinality we have in our types, the less bugs will occur as we limit the possible inputs to our functions. With TypeScript it's convenient to use a type such as *any* but we're better of avoiding using the *any* type. By consistently being as strict as possible in our type usage, we facilitate better integration between different developers and teams. This is definitely true stricter typing helps with defining the limits of your code while also documenting your code indirectly.
