## Paris!
This year for the first time Ordina JWorks travelled to Paris to attend a two day conference on CSS and JS, more exactly dotCSS and dotJS which are part of the dotConfernces. dotConferences is a series of developer events in Paris that started in 2012. 

In this blogpost we go quickly over the different talks, all the talks can be found on the [YouYube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/dotconferences){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} of the dotConferences.


## Wireless conference
All the dotConferences are wireless-less conferences. This means they don't foresee any WiFi in the building and ask to not use laptops in the audience. They foresaw a different area where you could use your laptop and had electricity for your laptop.

### 'Power of SVG' by [Sara Soueidan](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

Some websites really have nice visuals that contribute to a pleasant user experience when visiting them.  Think of brands that incorporate their logos in images for instance, or cover pictures that look like some Instagram filters were applied to them. You would think that such assets are created by designers and that they are applied directly to the webpage, but there is also a way to get those Photoshop effects straight into your browser. 
 
Sara Soueidan showed us a few possibilities to apply some stunning visual effects on images and text with code. First she discussed some techniques that designers use to create templates in Photoshop and afterwards she applied the same techniques by only using SVG. It was very impressive to see how you can manipulate images by applying a set of SVG filters. Hopefully using those SVG techniques will become more common in the future so that more visual appealing websites will be created with the power of SVG.

### 'Reading Hex codes' by [David DeSandro](https://twitter.com/desandro){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

This was one of the most mind blowing talks of dotCSS by far.
[David DeSandro](https://twitter.com/desandro){:target="_blank"} begins the talk with saying he has a special ability.
He can read color hex codes. 
At that moment the most of us were like what?
You can tell the color based on the hexcode?
Is that even possible?
And well, he proved it to us that you really can tell the color based on the hex code.
He even showed us how to do so.

And so he told us that it requires 5 steps to read color hex codes.
1. 3-digit shorthand 
2. Line graph
3. Hue from shape 
4. Lightness from total
5. Saturation from range

Just like this I bet you have no idea what these steps mean.
But let us teach you the magic of reading color hex codes as well thanks to [David](https://twitter.com/desandro){:target="_blank"}.

To get started he teached us that the best way to describe colors is with the HSL color model.
HSL stands for Hue, Saturation and Lightness. 
Hue is the pure pigment of a color and can be described with 12 color names.
We'll show you the color names later in Step 3.
Saturation is how vibrant or muted the hue is and can be described as *saturated*, *washed*, *muted* or *gray*.
Lightness speaks for it's self and describes how light or dark the color is and this can be done with *light*, *middle* or *dark*.

Now you know how you can describe a color all you have to do is to follow the 5 steps.
And deterimine the Hue, lightness and saturation.
So let's get started!

#### Step 1: 3-digit shorthand
To better understand the process let's take `#D49B25` as an example.
The first step is to retrieve the 3-digit shorthand of the hexcode.
This can be done easily by breaking up the hexcode in 3 pairs (D4 | 9B | 25).
Keep in mind that each pair represents a value of the RGB color channel.
Now drop the second number of each pair and that gives us the shorthand code `#D92`.

#### Step 2: Line graph
With the shorthand from step one we have to create a linegraph based on the numbers of the hexcode.
With basic understanding of hexadecimal numbers we can visualize a little line graph for the channel values.
D is high, 9 is around the middle, 2 is low.
And that's how we get our litle line graph.

<img class="image fit" alt="Hex linegraph example" style="max-width: 25%;" src="/img/2018-11-08-dot-css-dot-js-2018/hex-linegraph.jpg">
<img class="image fit" alt="Line graph of shorthand hex for color #D92" style="max-width: 25%;" src="/img/2018-11-08-dot-css-dot-js-2018/linegraph.jpg">

#### Step 3: Hue from shape
This is what we think  it's the most tricky part about reading color hex codes.
With the line graph we got from the previous step you'll have to find a matching color on the color wheel.
So you'll have to remember this one by hearth if you really want to show off ;)
For our example color it matches best with the color **orange**.

<img class="image fit" alt="HSL color wheel with color names" style="max-width: 75%" src="/img/2018-11-08-dot-css-dot-js-2018/color-wheel.jpg">

#### Step 4: Lightness from total
To determine the lightness you should look at the total sum of the channel values (pairs).
Or just look at the values in the line graph we created.
If the values are higher to the top, the color is closer to white and thus lighter.
If the values are closer to the bottomn, the color is closer to black and thus darker.
For our example color `#D92`, the values are both high and low, so it has **middle** lightness.

<img class="image fit" alt="Determining lightness of a color" style="max-width: 50%" src="/img/2018-11-08-dot-css-dot-js-2018/lightness.jpg">

#### Step 5: Saturation
Saturation is a measure of how vibrant or rich the hue/color is.
To measure the saturation whe need to see at the difference between the highest and the lowest value in our shorthand code.
The wider the range, the higher the saturation. 
Colors with small range have low saturation, appearing faded.
A color with no saturation is a pure gray.

<img class="image fit" alt="Measuring and describing saturation of a color" style="max-width: 50%" src="/img/2018-11-08-dot-css-dot-js-2018/saturation.jpg">


With our color, #D92, D is the highest value, 2 is the lowest.
D is high. 2 is low.
That's a wide range, but not completely wide.
So our color has moderate saturation, thus making it a **washed** color.

Now we have all three attributes for our color
So we can say `#D49B25` is **Middle Washed Orange**.
Pretty amazing right?

<img class="image fit" alt="#D49B25 color described as Middle Washed Orange" style="max-width: 50%" src="/img/2018-11-08-dot-css-dot-js-2018/final-color.jpg">

Since dotCss put's most of it's talks online we definitely recommend watching this talk.
He just explains it so well and goes a little bit deeper than we did here.

### 'Breaking the norm with creative CSS' by [Aga Naplocha](https://twitter.com/aganaplocha){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

The last presentation of the dotCSS conference was about using other inspirations and tools to build webpages. Aga made a bold remark that most of the websites out there have the same structure and even look and feel the same. With her talk she wanted to encourage developers to try and use other CSS Properties for building and designing websites. The three CSS properties she mentioned were clipping, masking and shape outside (all in combination with SVG). She showed each property with a clear example and discussed the differences between them. She also mentioned the compatibility of each property in the different browsers. 

Saying that most of the websites have the same look and feel is a bold statement but after you look around for a while you notice that she actually has a point. Most of the websites are using frameworks that give you a uniform, recognizable look and feel but are also really easy to use. With the properties she mentioned you can certainly build a beautiful, well-designed website but it would take more time to make sure you have a responsive website that has the same look and feel over the different browsers and devices.

### 'The State of JS' by [Sacha Greif](https://twitter.com/sachagreif){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

As we all know, the JavaScript ecosystem is richer than ever where even the most experienced developers become victims of the amount of choices they have to make.
It's always changing. New libraries, frameworks, languagues...
For this reason Sacha Greif, Raphaël Benitte and Michael Rambeau decided to create a global survey they called the 'State of JavaScript'.

The survey contains data from over 20000 developers all around the globe and you can find the results on their 
[website](https://stateofjs.com){:target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'}.
The survey tries to figure out what these developers are using these days, what they like and what they would love to learn.

When they published the State of JS results of 2018 there was a lot of commotion regarding the results.
More specifically regarding the front end frameworks Angular, React and Vue.
The State of JS survey declares that Angular is suffering alot in comparison with React and Vue.
The Angular results are very disappointing and show us a high rate of dissatisfaction within its userbase.
On the other side there is only love for both React and Vue.
This lead to a war on Twitter and other channels saying the survey is flawed.

Whether or not this is the case, I believe this survey can help lots of developers make choices and it gives at least some insights on the State of JavaScript.
Besides the front end frameworks, the State of JS also offers lots of data of other subjects regarding JavaScript which are definitely worth checking out!

### 'Learning to Love Type Systems' by [Lauren Tan](https://twitter.com/sugarpirate_){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

Since the introduction of TypeScript in 2012, web development has consistently looked more towards building software with the use of static typing. Lauren discussed why we should embrace the use of optional static typing that TypeScript provides. By using types, we add more constraints to our code and how other developers can use our code. Thus this decreases the amount of possible bugs during the development phases of a project. According to Lauren, types are mathematical propositions on how a program should work and the written code that complies to the types is a proof of the type system.

Lauren explained that while using types we should be as strict as possible. The lower cardinality we have in our types, the less bugs will occur as we limit the possible inputs to our functions. With TypeScript it's convenient to use a type such as *any* but we're better of avoiding using the *any* type. By consistently being as strict as possible in our type usage, we facilitate better integration between different developers and teams. This is definitely true stricter typing helps with defining the limits of your code while also documenting your code indirectly.

### 'Choosing Your JavaScript Framework' by [John Papa](https://twitter.com/john_papa){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

With all the current JavaScript frameworks out there it's hard to pick one to work with. During [his talk](https://www.dotconferences.com/2018/11/john-papa-choosing-your-javascript-framework){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, 
John Papa took a closer look to the three most popular frameworks at the moment: Angular, React and Vue.

When choosing the framework for your project you could ask yourself questions like _"Does it have all the features that I need?"_, 
_"What about the documentation?"_, _"Is it backed by a strong community?"_ or _"How fast is the framework?"_.
In this case all three frameworks would apply. But they all have a different way to work with components, lazy loading, state management and other stuff.  
Take for example the language it's written in. With Angular comes TypeScript, but React and Vue are by default JavaScript. 
Do you fancy TypeScript but you don't like to work with Angular? No issue, you can perfectly use TypeScript in React and Vue.

They all are perfect for building successful applications and you can go on for hours on which one is the best.
But in the end it comes down to one question: _"How does the framework make you feel when you use it?"_.  
The only way to find out is by __trying each one__. That's why John Papa created a Tour of Heroes project for each framework.

* [Tour of Heroes with Vue](https://jpapa.me/heroes-vue){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

Do you wanna know which one he choose? Well, he did not want to reveal that during the talk...

### 'JavaScript on the Desktop, Fast and Slow' by [Felix Rieseberg](https://twitter.com/felixrieseberg){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

Javascript is everywhere today, even in desktop applications e.g. Battlefield 1, Nvidia GeForce Experience and Adobe Creative Suite. 
Felix reveals his four tricks that can make your application more efficient. 

Before importing a specific module, really consider if you need all of its functionalities as it might bring in some additional items that you don’t need. 
When you do require a specific module, make sure you embed it at the right place. 
Also Node.js comes with V8 which is a Javascript engine. 
This engine runs every time you build and compiles your code into something your machine can execute. 
You can easily cache this with the module `v8-compile-cache`. 

Repainting the screen is an expensive operation. 
You can check with Chrome Developer Tools how much this operation costs and maybe tweak some code. 

His third trick is that not all code is equal. 
Sometimes there is a more efficient way to structure your code or use different function calls with the same end result that could make your application faster. 
Using `getElementByClassName` instead of `querySelectorAll` for example would be 99% faster.

And to close off, application lifecycle.
If your application is minimized, pause the network requests and stop refreshing every couple of seconds. 
You can check this with `document.hidden`.
