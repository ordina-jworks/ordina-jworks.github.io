# Devoxx Poland 2017

Krakow in the ICE Krakow Congress Centre.

We started off day 1 with the keynote in the absolutely, phenomenal main room:

## Keynote: Speed without Discipline: a Recipe for Disaster ([Venkat Subramaniam](https://twitter.com/@venkat_s))

Venkat kicked off the keynote, talking about a paradigm shift, that is happening right now in software development:
In the nineties, everybody was doing **imperative programming**, using objects to implement functionality.
Nowadays, this style of software development is shifting towards a more **declarative approach**.
In imperative programming, developers focus on both **what** they want to do and **how** they want to do it. 
In declarative programming on the other hand, developers focus on **what** they want to do and use tools and libraries to facilitate their goal.
Venkat went on to state that programming in a functional style is declarative, but that not all declarative code is functional.

	Functional style = declarative style + higher order functions

{% highlight JavaScript %}
let names = ["Dieter", "Tom", "Andreas", "Ken", "Yannick", "Tim", "Bart"];

let count = 0;
for(const name of names){
  if(name.length === 4)
    count++;
}
console.log(count);

console.log(names.filter(name => name.length === 4).size);
{% endhighlight %}

### Declarative vs Imperative

Venkat told the audience that he doesn't like driving cars.
He compared driving a stick shift to imperative programming.
His goal is going from point A to point B and he does not want to be involved in changing the gears _(Manipulating the DOM)_.
A car with an automatic drive train, is a step in the right direction, but still requires too much focus on how he wants to reach his destination _(Using a library like JQuery)_.
Using the auto pilot functionality in certain modern cars is another step in the correct direction, but what he really wants is a car with a dedicated driver, like Uber or Lyft offer _(Abstracting the DOM and using frameworks like Angular)_.
In this comparison the ride-sharing service is the declarative approach.

### Testing

> I automate my tests, not because I have a lot of time, but because I don't.

After an introduction to declarative programming, Venkat switched to the topic of testing.
To really be agile, we need to be confident that implementing new features won't cause failure.
We can achieve this confidence by automating our tests and making sure they are repeatable.
If we are really confident, we might even be able to ship software, without running the application.

Writing software without writing tests is described as JDD: Jesus Driven Development. 
Pray that it works.
Obviously, TDD (Test Driven Development) makes a lot more sense.

### Testing vs verification

Testing and verification are two different things.
Verification is the process that checks if the code (still) works.
This is not something anyone should do manually, verification is exactly what should be automated.
Testing is the process that checks if a feature is correctly implemented.
Code represents what you have typed, not what you might have wanted the system to do.
It is the act of gaining insight in the application and the business.
This could well be a manual task.
Unfortunately, most of our industry has neglected this important difference.

The maturity of software verification can be categorized in three maturity stages. 
Projects without verification automation are in denial, they are building up an increasing technical debt.
The second stage describes projects that have some automated verification on the UI level. 
Venkat describes tools using WebDriver for UI level verification as a pathway to hell automation.
This test method can be represented in the ice-cream cone anti-pattern. 
For projects with the right level of automation, the pyramid pattern is a good representation.
The last maturity stage contains these projects with the right measure of automated verification.

### Discipline
Venkat drew a comparison with 1820, where patients died regularly within three weeks after being operating.
Doctors (Joseph Lister, Louis Pasteur) started cleaning their tools after surgery and noticed a positive trend in survival.

Analogous to the doctors back then, we need to discipline ourselves in software engineering.
This discipline is needed to keep up to speed and to stay agile, so that teams can react rapidly to customer requests. 
To build up this discipline, automated verification can be seen as the software equivalent of exercising.

>We're practicing a beautiful craft, let's go turn it into a wonderful profession. Focusing on quality and creative things.

## Feature Branches And Toggles In A Post-GitHub World ([Sam Newman](https://twitter.com/@samnewman))

Sam told us about his experience at a project where the team was having trouble merging branches.
The release branch for the next release was called R3, but for a large refactoring, branch R4 was created.
Afterwards, he described merging the branches as a car crash.
They even needed to introduce a dedicated R3-R4 merge bug fix team.
Later on, they set up **Continuous Integration** in order to prevent the merging issues.
The code, pushed by the developers, would get automatically validated by the CI setup.
The problem with the R3-R4 release was that validation was done only for a branch and not on the integrated branches.

>The integration should be validated every day and when the build breaks, fix it!

For unfinished work, we can wait until it is ready before checking in.
This exposes us to the risk of losing work when it's only on the developer's computer.

### Feature Branch

An alternative would be to create a **feature branch**, which brings us back to the problem of merging branches.

>Pain of merge = fn(size_of_merge, duration_since_last_merge)

Merging branches can be a difficult task and might lead to a commit race, offloading the effort to a colleague.

### Trunk-based development

A third option would be to 'check in anyway', called **trunk-based development**.
Every commit integrates to the trunk and developers should integrate their local changes daily.
Small changes and integrating often makes it easier to merge new code.

New half-finished features can be hidden with **feature toggles**.
These toggles can be managed using flags or configurations (eg, in Zookeeper, Consul, ...).
>A flag should be set and evaluated in as few places as possible, preferably only once each.
>Flags should be removed when the new implementation is done.

More info: [Trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/)

Changes to an existing functionality can be done by providing an abstraction above the existing functionality.
The new functionality can then be developed for the abstraction and when it is done, changed to the new implementation.
**Branch by abstraction** has the side-benefit that it can be used for **A/B and canary releasing**.

[The Continuous Delivery](https://www.amazon.de/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912) book tells us to treat every check-in as a possible release candidate.
Developers start with the assumption that it is worthy, the CI tool decides whether it truly is.
Deploy frequently with small changes, making it easier to rollback and lowering the risk of running into problems.

### Git

And then there was **Git**, developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) with the goal to merge a patch in less than three seconds.
In Git, branches are much more lightweight and every local repository contains the full source history.

In 2008, **[GitHub](https://github.com)** was founded and introduced pull requests.
If you wanted to contribute to open source projects before pull requests you had to:
* Develop it locally
* Generate a patch file 
* Mail it over to the project owners

This feature contributed to GitHub's success as three years later in 2011, they passed SourceForge and Google Code in popularity.

Sam made the remark that pull requests use branches, which might bring problems. 
On top of that **[GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow)** was introduced.
Because GitFlow introduces even more branches, it is in controversy with fast deployment and small changes cycle.
With tools like [Split](https://www.split.io) and [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com), GitFlow is not needed, if merged frequently.

The conclusion was that experimental and release branches, that might even never get merged, still have their uses.
The pull request mechanism works well in open source projects.
Except for experiments, releases and pull requests, Sam recommends to prevent branches and to **keep batch sizes small, integrate often and ship often**.
