# Introduction

KubeCon | CloudNativeCon is a conference organised by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation twice a year, alternating between Europe and US locations. 
This edition was done in Valencia in Spain. 
The conference is the industry conference for anything Kubernetes / container related technology. 
Talks range from end-user stories of the usage of Kubernetes, over methods to automate compliancy in Cloud to technical deep dives into specific cloud native building blocks.
Next to the talks, there's a solution exhibition as well.
This is where vendors and (CNCF) projects have booths and you can talk to core contributors of most of the projects.

# Key takeaways

## OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is an CNCF project focussed on capturing different telemetry signals from applications.
It's a collections of tools, SDKs and APIs that enable effective observability. 

In esssence, it's an ecosystem of tools that can instrument, capture and ship (currently) telemetry data to differnt systems. 
The idea is that the tooling to do so is provided by OpenTelemetry and the analysis, usage and storage is performed by other third party tools like Dynatrace, AWS X-Ray, Elastic, Grafana LGTM and any other toolstack supporting telemetry data.

# Meet the vendors

## Cast.ai cost optimization

We met Cast.ai at their booth because we were triggered by the slogan "half your cloud cost". 
Cast.ai is a SaaS solution aimed at reducing cost of a Kubernetes setup by performing multiple (AI based) optimizations. 
They work by installing an agent into your cluster and analyse all worksloads that are deployed.
Next, they provide a detailed report of the improvements you can make.
Their main approach is two-fold.


### Rightsizing

Based on the analysis of all workloads, Cast.ai will provide a suggestion with nodes that are sized just right for the workloads on your cluster.
Instead of using just a single VM type per node pool, they look at the workloads and which nodes would be most cost effective. 
Since this approach optimizes for the CPU, memory and storage requests in your cluster at a moment in time, you'll have to set the correctly as well. 

### Spot instances

The second suggestion / approach they have is the usage of spot instances. 
When spot capacity is available in your selected regions, they will spot instances and attach them to your cluster.
Since spot instances are vastly cheaper, this can generate up to 60% in savings. 
One of the requirements for this approach to work is that either all workloads have multiple replicas, or the cluster can sustain some workload downtime (e.g. integration cluster, some development cluster, ...). 

## VMWare Tanzu

VMWare was present with their Tanzu team. 
They showcased how Tanzu solves the software supplychain challenges with support opensource software. 
Ranging from tooling to support an in-house training self-service portal to native building of images using Contour (CI) and KPack (Tanzu Build service) to managing large fleets of Kubernetes cluster across multiple (public) cloud providers, VMWare Tanzu solves all of it for you.

# Meet the city: Valencia

Of course, we also explored the city of Valencia during the hours that the conference was not in session. 


# Conclusion

## Focus

The focus of the conference was clearly on supply chain security and FinOps.
From a vendor perspective, there seemed to be a disproportial amount of Kubernetes distribution and hosting providers present.
