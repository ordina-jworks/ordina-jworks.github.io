# Percona Open Source Database Conference 2019 


> Percona, a leading provider of unbiased open source database solutions, organized its yearly European Open Source Database Conference in Amsterdam from September 30th till October the 2nd. This conference is an excellent opportunity to discover and discuss the latest open source trends, technologies and innovations, and off course Percona's own solutions. After Amsterdam in 2016 and Dublin in 2017, it was the third time Ordina Jworks signed up for this conference gradually becoming a tradition.

## Introduction

Nowadays, a company has to make many choices when determining an optimal database strategy. For example, does a company choose to lower the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) or avoid vendor lock-in by switching from a commercial to an open source database management system? Another choice your company stands for is a relational or non-relational database management system or both? And does a company bring its data to the cloud, or keep it on-premise? Choosing the right solution for the database strategy can sometimes be overwhelming.

We looked for answers to these questions during the Percona Open Source Conference. Of course this conference is not only an excellent opportunity for Percona to showcase its own products such as Percona Server for MySQL, Percona XtraDB Cluster, Percona Backup for MongoDB and much more, but it also shows, that there are many interesting things to tell about databases and more specifically about open source databases, because as a supporter of commercial database systems, you're not in the right place here.

As in previous editions of the Conference the concept remains unchanged.  The conference starts with a 'Tutorials Day' on the first day followed by 2 days of actual conference. Percona is the organizer of the conference so their tools and services will be discussed in detail, but with about 90 talks about everything that has to do with relational and non-relational open source databases, everyone will get their money's worth. It only makes it more difficult to choose which sessions to attend. 


## Keynotes

Each self-respecting conference starts with one or more keynotes which was also the case here. Percona Live was no exception and kicked off with 3 keynotes :

The first keynote mainly summarised the results of The Open Source Data Management Software Survey conducted by Percona in the run-up to the conference. More insights and useful information can be found in the [Open Source Data Management Software Survey](https://learn.percona.com/hubfs/Percona_Open_Source_DataManagement_Software_Survey_2019.pdf?__hstc=221416967.b5bed1057192b82e1b3e510771501218.1569922151538.1583767811856.1583848866284.9&__hssc=221416967.1.1583848866284){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

To gain a good insight into how the open source database landscape is evolving, various sources such as db-engines and Stack Overflow were consulted. The graph below shows the most commonly used databases according to Stack Overflow.

In these disruptive times, the popularity of open source databases is undoubtedly increasing. But how are the elephant, dolphin and sea lion currently doing? Which one is the most popular and how do they relate to each other? A small tour along the mini zoo of relational open source databases.

## The state of the elephant : PostgreSQL

 
<span class="image left"><img src="/img/2019-12-20-percona/postgreslogo.png" width="10%"></span>
 
PostgreSQL, as we know it under this name, is celebrating its 24th anniversary this year and the chart below clearly shows that its popularity is still growing. According to DB engines that measure database popularity, PostgreSQL is now the fourth most popular database, after Oracle, MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server, and was referred to as 'Database of the year' in both 2017 and 2018. In 2019 it had to pass on this title to MySQL. The last major release, version 12, was launched the day after the Percona conference.

Although the focus of the conference was on MySQL, PostgreSQL was also well represented at the conference with more than 37 talks on the subject. The postgreSQL sessions carried away my preference not least because it is a popular migration target, but also because the popularity increased in the most recent years, many developers think it is the coolest database out there.


Day 1 (Tutorials) : <BR>

*From a Database administrator point of view this was the most interesting training. After a brief overview of the different features within Postgress, the specific terminology was also discussed.  Within this training the necessary attention was also paid to the installation of PostgreSQL, the architecture, backup and partitioning within PostgreSQL.*

### Migrating to PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL has become a mature database and is known for its reliability, feature robustness, and performance. Able to handle all levels of workload with thousands of tools, extensions, connectors and community-contributed add-ons, it is a popular choice for Oracle database migration. But one of the main drivers is of course the cost, because Oracle's licensing model is often a nightmare. PostgreSQL commends itself as the World's most advanced open source relational database. 

So when the company's management has decided to migrate to PostgreSQL, is it a difficult task as Oracle DBA to make the switch? Not really. Because the fundamentals and features remain largely the same, the learning curve is not steep at all. A good starting point is the [wiki of postgress](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Oracle_to_Postgres_Conversion){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. 

There are several tools on the market that can assist you in converting an Oracle database into a PostgresSQL database, but keep in mind that is no tool that can convert 100% Oracle database into PostgreSQL, some manual changes are required. Below is a list of frequently used conversion tools, but a detailed description of each tool is beyond the scope of this blogpost

* [Ora2pg : Ideal for large migration projects](http://ora2pg.darold.net){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
* PostgreSQL Foreign Data Wrapper for Oracle : Ideal to move schemas and data
* Orafce : Compatibility functions
* [AWS Schema Conversion Tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/SchemaConversionTool/latest/userguide/CHAP_Welcome.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

The pitfalls you often encounter as an administrator were discussed in the session ***"Top 10 Mistakes When Migrating From Oracle to PostgreSQL"***



## The state of the dolphin : MySQL





<span class="image left"><img src="/img/2019-12-20-percona/mysqllogo2.png" width="5%"></span>

In 2019 MySQL took over the torch again from PostgreSQL as Database of the year. MySQL is one of the most widely used databases in the world and, in terms of popularity, only has to accept Oracle in front of them. The latest release, release 8, was released on April 19, 2018. With no less than 250 new features, this was a big leap forward from version 5.7. An overview of these new feature can be found [here](https://mysqlserverteam.com/the-complete-list-of-new-features-in-mysql-8-0/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. During several sessions some of these new features were discussed in more detail.

## The state of the sea lion : MariaDB


<span class="image left"><img src="/img/2019-12-20-percona/mariadblogo.png" width="5%"></span>

From the MariaDB graph we can deduce that the popularity has risen sharply in recent years, but the rate of increase has slowed down over the past year. There were only a handful of sessions on Mysql's fork at the conference.
