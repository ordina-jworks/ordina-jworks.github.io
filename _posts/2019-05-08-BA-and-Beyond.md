> The [BA & Beyond](https://ba-beyond.eu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} conference is a two day programme enabling business analysts to share their experiences and find inspiration in their daily work.
The conference was an intense mix of talks and workshops, providing space for inspiring people to share their stories. 
After each talk, the attendees had the possibility to engage in conversation during a Q&A. 
The sessions were very interactive and really empowering.
This second edition of the BA & Beyond conference was held during two days in Brussels and Amsterdam. 
Various topics were discussed, such as visual facilitation techniques, «How to Make an Agile Project Succeed», business analyst behaviours, or «The Inner Architecture of a Performer». 
What follows below is an overview of some of these talks.

## When BAs go BAD - Christina Lovelock

This talk is purely soft skills related and depicts the sort of behaviours shown by business analysts when they face difficult situations.
Some typical BA behavioural mistakes are triggered by the way they see themselves in the team. 
For instance, a BA could feel to be not part of the team: there are de facto less analysts than developers in a team which can lead to an « Us VS Them » mentality.
It is also sometimes difficult to build a BA community and the BA role sometimes being sandwiched between IT and the business, might lead to negative self perceptions such as « I am just a BA » or « Neither the PO nor the Developers understand me ».

Understanding that the BA is fully part of the team and is not the only one accountable for the communication between IT and Business, leads to better collaboration and is a great step towards agility, allowing all team members to be more confident and positive.
Whatever your role in a project team; collaboration, transparency, confidence - in yourself and in your team mates - as well as clear communication are key factors to succeed together.

Another difficulty in the BA role is having the right level of detail. 
Indeed it is sometimes difficult to have the right level of focus on the right things. 
Moreover, being a good BA is also about sharing knowledge, tools and techniques. 
Talking with other analysts and contributing to the practice are important aspects of the job.

Of course all those behaviours and feelings don’t just apply to business analyst but also to every team role: scrum master, developer, product owner, tester.
This talk gave us the opportunity to identify and name some feelings we can face as business analysts while giving us the keys to find solutions to the difficult situations we could face.
