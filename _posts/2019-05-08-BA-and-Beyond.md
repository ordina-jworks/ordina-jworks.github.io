> The [BA & Beyond](https://ba-beyond.eu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} conference is a two day programme enabling business analysts to share their experiences and find inspiration in their daily work.
The conference was an intense mix of talks and workshops, providing space for inspiring people to share their stories. 
After each talk, the attendees had the possibility to engage in conversation during a Q&A. 
The sessions were very interactive and really empowering.
This second edition of the BA & Beyond conference was held during two days in Brussels and Amsterdam. 
Various topics were discussed, such as visual facilitation techniques, «How to Make an Agile Project Succeed», business analyst behaviours, or «The Inner Architecture of a Performer». 
What follows below is an overview of some of these talks.

## When BAs go BAD - Christina Lovelock

This talk is purely soft skills related and depicts the sort of behaviours shown by business analysts when they face difficult situations.
Some typical BA behavioural mistakes are triggered by the way they see themselves in the team. 
For instance, a BA could feel to be not part of the team: there are de facto less analysts than developers in a team which can lead to an « Us VS Them » mentality.
It is also sometimes difficult to build a BA community and the BA role sometimes being sandwiched between IT and the business, might lead to negative self perceptions such as « I am just a BA » or « Neither the PO nor the Developers understand me ».

Understanding that the BA is fully part of the team and is not the only one accountable for the communication between IT and Business, leads to better collaboration and is a great step towards agility, allowing all team members to be more confident and positive.
Whatever your role in a project team; collaboration, transparency, confidence - in yourself and in your team mates - as well as clear communication are key factors to succeed together.

Another difficulty in the BA role is having the right level of detail. 
Indeed it is sometimes difficult to have the right level of focus on the right things. 
Moreover, being a good BA is also about sharing knowledge, tools and techniques. 
Talking with other analysts and contributing to the practice are important aspects of the job.

Of course all those behaviours and feelings don’t just apply to business analyst but also to every team role: scrum master, developer, product owner, tester.
This talk gave us the opportunity to identify and name some feelings we can face as business analysts while giving us the keys to find solutions to the difficult situations we could face.

## The 7 hidden layers behind agile techniques: Ever wondered why we use post-its during retrospectives? – Pieter Van Driessche

This talk was a great eye-opener about a simple thing we all do every day in our scrum teams: sticking post-its! 
Although this has become a very common habit, we might not know why post-its are used during scrum meetings and especially during retrospectives. 
Here is an insight.

### Psychological safety

Thanks to post-its, all participants get the same space. 
Post-its give everybody a voice, everybody can express themselves without fear. 
Moreover, post-its give a real chance to introvert people.

### Team objectives and peer pressures

By giving post-its to everybody attending the retrospective, peer pressure encourages everybody to participate and everybody will at least stick one post-it. 
And the more post-its we have, the greater the outcome we build.
This fact is closely linked to our comfort zone. 
Although it is sometimes difficult to say what we really think, the post-its and the peer pressure force us to get out of our comfort zone by expressing ourselves, finding solutions and being confronted with our team mates.
Getting out of our comfort zone promotes continuous improvement, and that’s what we all want.

### The physical connection

Moving post-its on a white board allows us to make abstract things tangible. 
As a consequence, we are more involved in our daily work as we, and the others, can see our progress in a physical way.

## You are doing it wrong: The truth about user stories – Pieter Hens

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Pieter Hens" src="/img/2019-05-08-ba-and-beyond/pieter-hens.jpg"></span>
[Pieter Hens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henspieter/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} has been working for over 15 years in a software product development and analysis setting. 
First as a researcher in the area of Business Process Modelling, later as an agile and lean practitioner. 
He has taken up roles as a business and functional analyst, project manager, coach and team lead in projects of various sizes. 
He currently specialises in the full range of software product management: product strategy, discovery and development.

As an agile and lean adept he speaks and trains on a professional and academic level (at VUB and KULeuven): agile analysis, agile project management and lean product management.

User stories are part of the root of our projects, we use them on a daily basis to achieve our goals, however the user stories are sometimes wrongly used, leading to counterproductive effects.
Here are some myths about user stories.

### The analyst writes the user stories and the dev team implements them

Writing a user story is not the BA responsibility, elaborating a user story is a team effort and everybody in the team is eligible to write user stories.
Writing the user stories together reduces risk of misunderstanding. 
Before implementing a user story, all team members should agree on and understand the user story content.

### We don’t need documents or models anymore

User stories have to be backed up by documents and models. 
A user story alone is not enough, we need a context and the big picture.
User stories are not meant o replace documents but to tell stories.

### If it does not fit the 'As a \[role] I can \[do something]' - template, it is not a user story

Having a template for the user story is an good way to ease the understanding of the common goal. 
Having our requirements standardized simplifies the processes.
However, not all user stories fit the same strict template. 
Even though a template is important, we should focus less on the template and more on the content itself.

## Conclusion

I learned a lot during those two days and the conference gave me new keys to deal with my work every day.
This great experience also gave me the opportunity to talk and share with other business analysts. 
It was really inspiring.
