## Half-Agile:  5 Leadership mistakes Diluting Your Transformation, by Jesse Fewell

Jesse shares with us 5 patterns on our journey to an Agile organisation. 
He explains why this journey can be so hard, especially for leaders (team leads, scrum masters, technical leads, managers or executives).

You start with a good decision, that somehow gets frustrated and agitated. Then you discover the mistake and you can take an action to correct it.

### Buy-in, Engagement

Very often you have a good idea and just tell the people around you to execute it. 

But along the way you forget to explain the reasoning behind this idea, which leads to misunderstanding and frustration.

As leaders it's your job to create context for the change and communicate methodically and excessively. This is hard, because it takes time, repetition and requires patience.

### Impact

The first good step, as a leader, is to take initiative. 
Other departments may not want to be Agile, so you will start alone. You'll be the role model to set the tone of for the organisation.

However, this leads to a team trying to be Agile in an environment that is not Agile. And you end up doing Water-SCRUM-Fall or Modern Waterfall.

So you need to take the next action: invite others to the table.
If you want the Agile journey to move forward it has to be about Agile, not just YOUR Agile. Allow the journey to evolve instead of following a fixed methodology.

### Practices

You often tell colleagues to follow standard techniques, like: Daily Standups, Spring Planning, Retrospectives, ... 
These are the practices that everyone uses. So if you want to be like everyone else, you should apply these techniques.

If you try to be like everyone else, you'll never be ahead of everyone else!

You need to experiment, try things out. Not just do things because others do them or because you read them in a book.
You need to find YOUR Agile. Don't just copy-past your Agile. 

### Workload

Everybody is struggling with more complexity, more change and more requirements. But there are loads of good opportunities and you want to do all of them.

People get overwhelmed by this, because there is so much work and now we want to do an Agile change or transformation. 

You should try not to over-commit.
Find your One Thing that you can focus on, so that you can make more progress with the same effort.
Learn to say NO, with diplomacy.

### Talent

When you want to go on an Agile journey, you want everyone else to get better. 
As a leader, you take the role of a mentor. You show and teach that you are Agile and they need to follow you.

But you get frustrated, because they are not changing fast enough. You feel like you are Agile, but they are not.
Because you forgot about yourself as the leader. 
If you want to transform your organisation, you need to first transform yourself as a leader in the organisation.

You need to challenge your own assumptions. Take a leadership training or workshop and get inspired.
Maybe you need to think about:
 - **delegating** more instead of doing;
 - shifting from explaining methods to articulating **goals**; or
 - instead of telling people what to do, give them the **ability to do it themselves**

This personal growth requires that you go on a long term journey of transforming yourself as a leader.
