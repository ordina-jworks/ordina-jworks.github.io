## Intro
TODO

<img alt="TODO image" src="{{ '/img/virtualreality/todo.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="image fit">

VR is not new! <br>
It is infact pretty old compared to other technologies. //TODO
AR isn't that new either. Perhaps MR is? I'll leave that up to you to decide.

Ever since we are able to create visual representations of our world or an alternate world, 
mankind has been fascinated by inhabiting this other world or virtual world.


## History

// TODO can i use the wikipedia picture of the sensorama? what about copyright and stuff. apparently it is free to use but needs proper attribution... didn't read further

//TODO insert Sensorama picture here
in 1962 some crazy person built what is generally believed to be the first virtual reality experience.
This machine pictured above is called the Sensorama. 
The user of the Sensorama sits on a tilting chair and watches a short film with stereoscopic 3D images in wide-angle view with stereo sound 
and even wind and aroma. 
A little bit reminiscent of those 4D films shown in themeparks.

Ofcourse this is nothing like the VR experiences we have today.
// should I use XR instead of VR here? any better term to describe all kinds of realities? "other realities"?

//maybe expand a bit more on the history. might be important parts I missed
In the 70's and 80's virtual reality really started blossoming in certain specialized areas.
In 1968 Dr Ivan Sutherland created the Sword of Damocles at MIT.
This head mounted display (or HMD) was so heavy it needed to be suspended from the ceiling.
It was able to track head movements and show rudimentary 3D images.
// TODO insert sword of damocles picture
In the military flight simulators and combat simulators started showing up,
simulators for doctors and surgeons.
Different ways of interacting with this virtual world also started appearing.
Head tracking, touch screens, gloves... //TODO add more
This is also when videogame companies tried to capitalise on this exciting new technology and bring it to a wider public.
But the technology was still rough and did not catch on in big numbers.

//TODO intro new VR with oculus in 2012



## Different types of realities // or should I use the "all kinds of realities" title here?

Alright, so we have been talking about virtual reality for a while.
But what exactly is virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR) and all that goodness?

//TODO insert picture reality - virtuality continuum. the one from wikipedia is good, same as in the slides.
Above you see the reality - virtuality continuum.

Let's start on the left side.
The left side depicts Reality or the Real World. 
With the Real World we mean the world where you, as the reader of this article, most likely, are sitting in a chair looking at your computer screen or holding your smartphone.
For the sake of this article we assume that is the real world and there are no matrix-like shenanigans going on.
Simply put, the world as you know it outside of any screens.

On the other end of the spectrum we see the Virtual Environment.
Everything in the virtual environment is virtual, so 'not real'.
It is the imaginary world that you see on a screen.
The user is locked out of the real world.

Augmented Reality (AR) and Augmented Virtuality (AV) lie a bit in the middle then.
As their names suggest, AR is more closely aligned to the real world
while AV is closer to the virtual world.
In other words AR consists of mostly real world with a few virtual elements augmenting the experience.
AV exists mostly in the virtual world with a few elements of our real world visible.
 // TODO describe this later ==> In practice this usually means an overlay 

Mixed reality or Merged reality (MR) is a term used to describe anything between reality and virtuality.
This means it contains both elements of the real world and a virtual world.
It can go all the way from mostly real world with a bit of virtual world sprinkled on top
to mostly virtual world with a few traces of the real world visible.
With MR, as opposed to AR and AV, the real world and virtual world are aware and can interact with eachother!

These terms are pretty vague and some have even changed meaning over the years.
No need to think too much about these terms.
