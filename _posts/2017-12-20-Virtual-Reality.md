## Intro
The concept of virtual reality is not a new one, neither is the one of augmented reality.
It has been around for quite a long time already.
Perhaps mixed reality is will be the next big thing? 
I'll leave that up to you to decide.

Ever since we have been able to create visual representations of our own or other worlds, mankind has been fascinated by transferring the sensory perception into this world.
It is in the recent years that technological advancements have made it possible to do this in ever increasing realistic and engaging ways.


## A trip down memory lane...
<img alt="Sensorama" src="{{ '/img/virtualreality/sensorama.jpeg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto; max-width: 600px;">

In 1962 some crazy person built what is generally believed to be the first virtual reality experience.
This machine pictured above is called a Sensorama. 
The user of the Sensorama sits on a tilted chair and watches a short film with stereoscopic 3D images in wide-angle view with stereo sound and even added effects such as wind and aroma. 
A predecessor of those 4D movies available in cinemas en theme parks these days.

This of course cannot be compared with the more advanced implementations we have today.

In the 70's and 80's virtual reality really started blossoming in certain specialized areas.
In 1968 Dr Ivan Sutherland created the Sword of Damocles at MIT.
This head mounted display (or HMD) was so heavy it needed to be suspended from the ceiling.
It was able to track head movements and show rudimentary 3D images.

<img alt="Sword of Damocles" src="{{ '/img/virtualreality/damocles.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto; max-width: 600px;">

During the 90's and 00's more sophisticated military, flight and combat simulators started showing up.
In the privatized industry simulators for airline pilots, doctors and surgeons.
Different ways of interacting with this virtual world also started appearing:
- Head tracking
- Touch screens
- Gloves
- Entire flight simulators
- ...

This is also when video game companies first tried to capitalize on this exciting new technology and bring it to a wider audience.
But the technology was still too rough and did not catch on.
Some of these early attempts include:
- Nintendo Virtual Boy
- Virtuality (arcade system)
- iGlasses
- VFX-1

But then came 2012.
The year in which the Oculus Rift was kickstarted. 
This sparked a renewed interest in virtual reality, which thanks to technological innovations was looking much, much better it ever had!

## All kinds of realities
Alright, so we have been talking about virtual reality for a while.
But what exactly are virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) and how do they relate.

<img alt="The reality - virtuality continuum" src="{{ '/img/virtualreality/continuum.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto; max-width: 600px;">
Above you see the reality - virtuality continuum.

Let's start on the left side.
The left side depicts Reality or the Real World. 
With the Real World we mean the world where you, as the reader of this article, are sitting in a chair looking at your computer screen or holding your smartphone.
For the sake of this article we assume that the world is real and there are no matrix-like shenanigans going on.
Simply put, the world as you know it and experience it every day, the world you and I live in.

On the other end of the spectrum we see the Virtual Environment.
Everything in the virtual environment is virtual, so 'not real'.
It is the imaginary world that you see on a screen.
The user is locked out of the real world.
An extreme example we all know of this would be the Matrix, in which the person lives his or her live inside the matrix not knowing the entire thing is not real.

Augmented Reality (AR) and Augmented Virtuality (AV) are situated in between these two ends of the spectrum.
As their names suggest, AR is more closely aligned with the real world
while AV is closer to the virtual world.
In other words AR consists of a mostly real world with a few virtual elements augmenting the experience.
AV exists mostly in the virtual world where a few elements of our real world visible.

Mixed or Merged reality (MR) is a term used to describe anything between reality and virtuality.
This means it contains both elements of the real world and a virtual world.
It can go all the way from a mostly real world with a bit of virtual world sprinkled on top to mostly virtual world with only trace elements of the real world remaining visible.
With MR as opposed to AR and AV, the virtual world is aware of the real world and can interact accordingly.

We see the term X-realities being used to describe any of the VR, AR, MR and any other realities.

These terms are pretty vague and some have even changed meaning over the years.
They outline the boundaries of the different areas in the spectrum, but they tend to bleed over into one another very easily, and get mixed up a lot!


### Virtual Reality
We call something Virtual Reality when the user is emerged in a virtual world and completely blocked out from the real world.
This can be as simple as a 360 video.
(In practice you can still see through the cracks of cheaper headsets)
The user interacts, through various modes of control, with the virtual world.

//TODO FIXME
Some use cases of virtual reality are
* Games, both recreational and educational
* Photo content: photo spheres
* Video content: video spheres, 360 videos
* Creative applications like 3D painting or sculpting or dj application //TODO: just say "Creative applications" or already include the examples?

Currently the most popular application for VR is video games. There are a lot of games out already.
Shooting games and simulators seem to be an especially well fit for the platform.
A VR headset is also often used for viewing 360 pictures and videos.
Thanks to the head tracking, the view of the picture or video can be changed really intuitively.
Though you have the additional setup to deal with compared to a phone where you can just drag the viewport or use your phone's motion sensors.

//TODO some more. check presentation. controls etc


### Augmented Reality
//TODO insert picture of pokémon go
<img alt="Sensorama" src="{{ '/img/virtualreality/sensorama.jpeg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto; max-width: 600px;">

Everyone knows this right?
Last year, the world exploded with people young and old crowding the streets in search for Pokémon.

Pokémon Go is a fine example of an AR application.
It is Augmented Reality because the application is still grounded mostly in the real world.
The virtual elements are layered on top of the real world.

There are 4 types of Augmented Reality applications.
* Marker
* Inverse Marker
* Markerless 
* Projection

//TODO, add following line?
(There are other types of classification systems but we have gone with this one)

// TODO include collage picture with 4 types or 4 separate pictures
Marker based AR apps use image recognition to recognize a specific pattern or marker.
On the location of this pattern an image is then shown on the screen. //TODO rewrite
These types of applications are often very simple for example for showing a character from a movie dancing on the table.
Inverse marker based AR is very similar to regular marker based AR.
These applications are used in conjunction with large screens with cameras where the user only has to control the marker.
There are also applications that do not use a marker.
These markerless applications use positional tracking and gps to determine where to show things.
The popular Pokémon Go and Ikea apps are perfect examples of this.
Projection based AR projects images rather than showing them on the screen.
This requires hardware capable of projecting so is not as widespread.
It is used more in manufacturing.

The great thing about AR is that any smartphone is capable running AR applications.
Many AR apps only need a camera to work.
While specialized depth sensing sensors exist, they are not as widespread.


### Mixed Reality

//TODO !!

Mixed Reality takes the best of all worlds!
Mixed reality will not replace either AR or VR but does take features from both.
What makes Mixed Reality special is that it understands the environment.
They take the form of glasses or headsets with cameras and other sensors.
Often sensors are used to map the physical 3D space so the virtual objects know where they are situated.
This is where you get the holographic experiences.
They are not real holograms but look and act exactly as you would expect from a hologram.
If you are still looking through the glasses or headset that is.


## Creating realities

Since these kind of applications are often so visual in nature, we can make use of tools used in game development.  
These are some of the most popular and free tools.
* Unity
* Unreal Engine
* CryEngine

Think of these as sort of photoshop for software.
We can leverage the editors to see what we're working on and make changes immediately.
These tools are ideal for Virtual Reality.
Both Unity and Unreal Engine have plugins available for Augmented Reality.

Apple's ARKit and Google's ARCore are the respective Augmented reality APIs for their IOS and Android platforms.
Since the inception of these two APIs the amount of AR apps has greatly increased.
There are many other SDKs available.
Many of which even have their own Unity plugin.
Vuforia and ARToolkit seem to be the most popular ones.
Google is even discontinuing it's Tango project in favor of ARCore.

Microsoft created the Windows Mixed Reality framework for Mixed, Virtual or Augmented reality apps to run on windows 10 pc's.


## Business cases & Examples
//TODO: Examples of AR/VR/MR 
// ar and mr seem to have more business value

So, as software developers, what can we do with all this fancy tech?

Our Dutch colleagues already made a cool VR application!

Virtual Reality is still widely used for training purposes.
Whether it is for a boat, an aircraft, a machine or a human body, a virtual space can prepare someone for situations that are otherwise very costly or difficult to simulate.

Showing information when and where you need it.
On a mobile phone screen, through glasses or projected on a surface, having the correct information at hand is always useful.

Visualizing a product before it is manufactured can enhance the design process by discovering points of improvement much earlier on.
Visualization like Ikea's app for trying furniture or a tour through historic Bruges or even business cards with an AR marker for increased memorability.

For us at Ordina, we see most potential in AR and MR.


## Conclusion

A lot of things are still shaping up in the X-realities space.
Early forms of VR have existed for a while but the current form is still not very mature.
Virtual Reality is not near the real thing yet.
A lot of solutions and standards are still being figured out.
Which means now is a great time for us to try stuff out!
