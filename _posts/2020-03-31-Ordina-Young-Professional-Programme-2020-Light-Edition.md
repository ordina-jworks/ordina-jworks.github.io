# Introduction
The Young Professional Programme is made for starting developers who want to take their skills to the next level. This year, the light edition started on the 9th of March 2020 and lasted for about 2 months. 

# Young professionals
This year, we started with 4 junior developers. Youri was freshly graduated from school, while Eduard, Pieter and Hannelore had professional experience in IT.
Every one of us is interested in front end web development by sheer coincidence.

# Training
## Introduction
In the first month of the Young Professional Programme we got an education about the preferred stack used at Ordina. Sadly, about a week in our sessions were held remotely due to the Corona Virus. This made things more complicated, but because of the flexibility and effort of the mentors, the sessions were still clear and educational.
