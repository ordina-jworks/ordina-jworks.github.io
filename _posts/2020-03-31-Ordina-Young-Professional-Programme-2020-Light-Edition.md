# Introduction
The Young Professional Programme is made for starting developers who want to take their skills to the next level. This year, the light edition started on the 9th of March 2020 and lasted for about 2 months. 

# Young professionals
This year, we started with 4 junior developers. Youri was freshly graduated from school, while Eduard, Pieter and Hannelore had professional experience in IT.
Every one of us is interested in front end web development by sheer coincidence.

# Training
In the first month of the Young Professional Programme we got an education about the preferred stack used at Ordina. Sadly, about a week in our sessions were held remotely due to the Corona Virus. This made things more complicated, but because of the flexibility and effort of the mentors, the sessions were still clear and educational. 

# Setup
The first few days of our training was centered around building a base for the coming weeks. Since we all just got our laptops the day before we didn't have anything installed on them so, that was the focus on the first training day.
So on the first day of our training we got the chance to install all programs and tools required for the rest of our training, think of things like Docker, Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, Git,...
He also showed us a variety of different editors and IDEs and let us pick the one we preferred.

After that we had a session about Git which is obviously an essential tool to understand for any modern developer. We saw the ins and outs of most of the git commands and we practiced the most common ones. We didn't just see Git but also how it came to be and it's predecessors. Overall it was an interesting session giving us a decent understanding of Git.

# Front end

## HTML, CSS, Javascript

Since the Young Professional programme teaches a wide array of technologies we had saw quite a few front end technologies.
Starting of with the basis of almost every front end technology, HTML5, CSS and Javascript. 
In the first part of this session we took a dive into the basics of HTML and CSS, after this we took a look at the more recent features of HTML5 and CSS3. The remainder of the session was mainly about JavaScript. Throughout the session we had some exercises to have a bit of an hands-on approach.

## Typescript
<img class="image right" alt="Typescript logo" src="/img/2020-03-31-Young-Professional-2020-Light/typescript.png">
Building on the basics we learned prior, we had a session about Typescript, a derivative of Javascript that is becoming more and more popular amongst most front end frameworks because of it's similarity to Javascript but also having types allowing stricter rules to be enforced and less random unexplainable errors. Similarly to the previous session we got an explanation on the basics of Typescript which was then used in some exercises.

## Angular

Eventually we reached the end of our front end training with a 2 day lasting Angular course. Everything we learnt the previous days was now being poured into a framework. In this course we, again, saw the basics of this massive Typescript framework. We saw everything from dependency injection to property binding. Angular is a framework built by Google so there are lots of features, because of this we didn't have enough time in those 2 days to really take a deep dive. On a later date we would get to spend enough time to get to know it better.


# Back end
## Java
Java is a general-purpose programming language that was released in 1995. which means it has been around for 25 years and has become very popular. In 2019 java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to github.
 

Java is a also the preferred backend language of JWorks. Yannick de Turck gave us a workshop around this programming language. we talked about the new features they released with each version from java 7 until 14.In between the theory we made some hands-on exercises on the new features like lambdas streams and optionals.
 

This was also the last day before the corona outbreak in Belgium.This means the rest of the Young professionals Program was given remotely. 
 
## Spring
The spring framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the java platform. it has become wildly popular in organizations and the java community. We followed a three-day self study course. were we read the book spring in action by Craig walls. This books gives you a general understanding of the spring framework.On the second day we followed a short Spring Presentation by Ken coenen.  Ken explained how all the spring magic works behind the scenes and we saw the common components of the full spring framework like security.
 
## Testing
We also had a course about testing from Casteels Maarten. first we had an interactive hands-on session about multiple subjects like test driven development, goals of testing, what to test, fixtures, mocks and assertions.

##  HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript
In the first part of this session we took a dive into the basics of HTML and CSS, after this, the new descriptive tags and features from HTML5 and CSS3 were seen as well. This was a good refresher, especially making the exercise. The result of the exercise was a basic form with CSS stylings.
The remainder of the session was mainly about JavaScript. After the basics were covered, there was an exercise. In this exercise communication with a dummy API was accomplished to display its information on a simple one-pager.
