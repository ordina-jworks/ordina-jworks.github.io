## Keynote: Speed without Discipline: a Recipe for Disaster

Paradigm shift right now
- 90's -> object related programming (before procedures)
- Latest -> imperative to declarative programming (functional programming, declerative thinking)

> Imperative: what you do and how you do it
> Declarative: let tools and library figure out how to do it

Functional is declarative, not all declarative code is functional.
Functional style == declarative style + higher order functions

## Declarative vs imperative

* Manual driving -> imperative
* Stick shift
* Auto pilot in Tesla
* Taxi with dedicated driver -> declarative 

## JavaScript

Black swan: ideal of concept you knew exists, but becomes unexpectedly prominent.
Nobody expected JavaScript to become so wildly used 10 years ago.
Venkat describes JavaScript as a slippery slope, never to use in the same sentence as logic.

## Testing

> Developing software without writing tests is described as JDD, Jesus Driven Development.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="nl"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Software development: a profession where people get paid to write poor quality code and get paid more later to cleanup the mess.</p>&mdash; Venkat Subramaniam (@venkat_s) <a href="https://twitter.com/venkat_s/status/648119106072387584">27 september 2015</a></blockquote>

> I like to automate my tests not because I have a lot of time, it is because I don't.

We get confidence from automational testing to implement new features without even running the application, this is what we need to keep agile.

## Test vs verification

Verification: does it still work?
Test: is it correctly implemented. Code does what you type, not what you meant.

No human should ever be asked to manually verify if code works.
>Test manually, verify automatically.

Phases of verification:
1. No Automation (denial, increasing depth)
2. Yes, but.. (selenium) Mostly UI level verification is pathway to hell automation. (Ice-cream cone pattern)
3. Right level to the right measure (test pyramid)

## Discipline
Automated verification is the software equivalent of exercising.

It's 1820 all over again, patients died regularly within 3 weeks after operating.
Doctors (Joseph Lister, Louis Pasteur) started cleaning his tools after surgery and noticed a positive trend in survival.

>We're practicing a beautiful craft, let's go turn it into a wonderful profession. Focusing on quality and creative things.
