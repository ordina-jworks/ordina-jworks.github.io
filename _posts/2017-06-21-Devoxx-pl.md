We started off day 1 with the keynote in the absolutely phenomenal main room:

## Keynote: Speed without Discipline: a Recipe for Disaster ([Venkat Subramaniam](https://twitter.com/@venkat_s))

Venkat kicked off the keynote, talking about a paradigm shift, that is happening right now in software development:
In the nineties, everybody was doing **imperative programming**, using objects to implement functionality.
Nowadays, this style of software development is shifting towards a more **declarative approach**.
In imperative programming, developers focus on both **what** they want to do and **how** they want to do it. 
In declarative programming, on the other hand, developers focus on **what** they want to do and use tools and libraries to facilitate their goal.
Venkat went on to state that programming in a functional style is declarative, but that not all declarative code is functional.

	Functional style = declarative style + higher order functions

### Declarative vs imperative

Venkat told the audience that he doesn't like driving cars.
He compared driving a stick shift to imperative programming.
His goal is going from point A to point B and does not want to be involved in changing the gears _(Manipulating the DOM)_.
A car with an automatic drive train, is a step in the right direction, but still requires too much focus on how he wants to reach his destination _(Using a library like JQuery)_.
Using the auto pilot functionality in certain modern cars is another step in the correct direction, but what he really wants is a car with a dedicated driver, like Uber or Lyft offer _(Abstracting the DOM and using frameworks like Angular)_.
In this comparison the ride-sharing service is the declarative approach.

### JavaScript

Black swan: ideal of a concept you knew exists, but becomes unexpectedly prominent.
Nobody expected JavaScript to become so wildly used 10 years ago.
Venkat describes JavaScript as a slippery slope, never to use in the same sentence as logic.

### Testing

> Developing software without writing tests is described as JDD, Jesus Driven Development.

> I like to automate my tests not because I have a lot of time, it is because I don't.

We get confidence from automational testing to implement new features without even running the application, this is what we need to keep agile.

## Test vs verification

Verification: does it still work?
Test: is it correctly implemented. Code does what you type, not what you meant.

No human should ever be asked to manually verify if code works.
>Test manually, verify automatically.

Phases of verification:
1. No Automation (denial, increasing depth)
2. Yes, but.. (selenium) Mostly UI level verification is pathway to hell automation. (Ice-cream cone pattern)
3. Right level to the right measure (test pyramid)

## Discipline
Automated verification is the software equivalent of exercising.

It's 1820 all over again, patients died regularly within 3 weeks after operating.
Doctors (Joseph Lister, Louis Pasteur) started cleaning their tools after surgery and noticed a positive trend in survival.

>We're practicing a beautiful craft, let's go turn it into a wonderful profession. Focusing on quality and creative things.
