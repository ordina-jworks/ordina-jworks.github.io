## It's not you, it's us: Winning over people for yourself and the team - Neha Batra

This was not a technical talk, but aimed to help with the daily technical management of project-teams. Neha's session was the most interactive one I attended at SpringOne Platform: about 10 minutes in the session, she wanted us to pair to do a personal SWOT analysis with a stranger in the room and see how we can learn from eachother. Everyone participated and I believe this might actually be useful in the context of a project. Something to try out!

She ended her session with a tool chest to prevent and mitigate issues as they come up:

* SWOT analysis 
* Personal goals
* Inception
* Set schedule / cadence
* Provide feedback
* Provide a "safe haven"
* Collect and discuss concerns
* Talk in person
* Write down useful conversations
* Find a way to align first (eg. TDD + pair programming)
* Daily retros

The slidedeck of the talk is available on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/NehaBatra5/its-not-you-its-us-winning-over-people-for-yourself-and-the-team).

## Ordina

Ordina sent 2 speakers to SpringOne Platform.

### Spring Boot Starter - Dieter Hubau

### Ignite: Microservices Dashboard - Andreas Evers
On Monday evening, Andreas pitched the [Ordina Microservices Dashboard](https://github.com/ordina-jworks/microservices-dashboard) that was released a couple of hours earlier.

## Simplifying the Future - Adrian Cockroft

The closing keynote at SpringOne Platform was reserved for one of the most influential people in our industry: [Adrian Cockcroft](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriancockcroft). Always at the edge of technology, Andrian often is credited with making Microservices a mature and useful architectural pattern. His talk focussed on:

* Simplifying work
* Simplify the organization
* Simplify things we build

I really recommended watching [his entire presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGK6jjamzfY) on YouTube.
