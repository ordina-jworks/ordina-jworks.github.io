## Introduction

These are trying times we are living in.  
Since the outbreak of the Corona virus we have been living in some form of lockdown.
We are limited in out ability to go out and do thing, and when we do it is recommended to take the necessary precautions like keeping a safe distance and wearing a mask.
The masks are among the things we didn't have enough of, certainly in the beginning of the outbreak.  
In this blog post I'll dig a little deeper in using 3D printing tech to make masks and other equipment/material that can be of use.

## Shortage in equipment

The strain on our healthcare system and the supplies has been massive.
Masks were kept for healthcare workers even if they were just surgical masks and not the FFP2/3 masks.
Masks are slowly becoming more widely available for the general population again, however the government relied on people to make their own masks in the beginning.  

Luckily our country was spared the overwhelming load on the hospitals like in Italy.
While the situation was very serious in the hospitals we never had a lack of ventilators or had to turn people away because the hospitals were at or already beyond their capacity.


## Can 3D printing help

3D printing is a very handy technology. 
It allows for rapid prototyping and small scale production without the need to set up a full production line.
The 3D printing community is a very large one, and also a very active one.

Very soon after reports about a lack of components for ventilators there were people in Italy who designed the valve required for the respirator

Masks designs were also popping up in the online communities, at first very basic and rudimentary designs but over the following days/weeks the designs became more specialized and optimized.

Note: These masks are not the real deal, they are not meant to be used in hospitals, they are meant to provide a means to protect oneself when not better materials/equipment is at hand.
