# Why Keycloak as Authentication Server
You can find several platforms that handle user logins and resource access management such as Keycloak, OKTA, OpenAM, etc. 
All those platforms have their own features and possibilities that may be useful for your use case. 
In this article, we choose [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} as [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [authorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} server which is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} identity and access management platform (IAM) from Red Hat's Jboss. 
We have chosen for Keycloak because [it is open-source](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [well-documented](https://www.keycloak.org/documentation.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

Keycloak comes with several handy features built-in:
* Two-factor authentication
* Bruteforce detection
* Social login (Facebook, Twitter, Google…)
* LDAP/AD integration
* …

We will go over the basics to get you started.

# Setting up a Keycloak Server

Keycloak supports [multiple ways](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_installation/index.html#_operating-mode){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} to be set up.
For non-production purposes, it's easiest to just [download](https://www.keycloak.org/downloads.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and run the standalone, which we will do here. 
For actual deployments that are going to be run in production you'll need to configure a shared database for Keycloak storage and set up Keycloak to run in a cluster to avoid a [single point of failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. 

At the time of writing, the latest release version was `6.0.1`. 

```bash
$ curl https://downloads.jboss.org/keycloak/6.0.1/keycloak-6.0.1.zip --output keycloak-6.0.1.zip
$ unzip keycloak-6.0.1.zip
$ cd keycloak-6.0.1/bin/
$ ./standalone
```

> For Windows users, there is also a `standalone.bat` in the same folder.

The Keycloak server is now running on port 8080.

> Use `-Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset` to change the port.  
`-Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=1000` will run the server on port 8080 + 1000 = 9080 

Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and create an administrator account.
You can now click on `Administration Console >` and log in using the account you've just created.  

You are now on the pre-defined Master realm. A realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups. 
A user belongs to and logs into a realm and they are isolated from one another and can only manage and authenticate the users that they control.  

The master realm is the highest level in the hierarchy. 
Admin accounts in this realm have permissions to view and manage any other realm. 
It's best to create a new realm to manage our application and users.

## Creating a New Realm

<div style="text-align: center;" >
    <img class="image fit-contain" src="{{ '/img/securing-web-applications-with-keycloak/create_realm.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="30%" />
</div>

Create a new realm by clicking on the drop-down arrow next to the realm name in the upper left corner.

<div style="text-align: center;" >
    <img class="image fit-contain" src="{{ '/img/securing-web-applications-with-keycloak/create_realm_2.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="60%" />
</div>

In this example, `heroes` is chosen as the name of the realm.
Feel free to change this to the name of your organisation if you have one.

## Creating a Client

Every application that interacts with Keycloak is considered to be a client.  
Let's create one for the [Single-Page App](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (SPA).  

Look for the `Clients` tab in the menu and hit `Create`.  
Pick a name you think is suitable and choose [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) (OIDC) as protocol.  
The `Root URL` can remain blank.  

<div style="text-align: center;" >
  <img class="image fit-contain" src="{{ '/img/securing-web-applications-with-keycloak/create_client.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="50%" />
</div>

After saving, we can see all the configuration options of the client.  
* `Valid Redirect URIs` should be set to `http://localhost:4200/*` as this is the address of our SPA  
* Allow all origins for testing purposes
* Single-page apps use a `public client` because they can not securely hide client credentials
* Make sure the `Standard Flow` is enabled. All other flows can be disabled

<div style="text-align: center;" >
  <img class="image fit-contain" src="{{ '/img/securing-web-applications-with-keycloak/configure_client.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="70%" />
</div>

> Standard flow is another name for the [Authorization Code Flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} as defined in [the OAuth 2.0 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

> `Direct Access Grants Enabled` may remain enabled for now. It will be easy to test our configuration later.

Don't forget to hit `Save` at the bottom of the form!

## Creating Roles and Scopes
Roles and scopes can be used to provide fine-grained access control to resources. 
We want them to be present when handling requests with our Spring Boot application. 
This part is optional, but can provide better insight in managing access to resources down the road.

Under `Roles` > `Add Role`, enter any name you like. 
Some standard roles are typically user or admin.

<div style="text-align: center;" >
  <img class="image fit-contain" src="{{ '/img/securing-web-applications-with-keycloak/create_role.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="80%" />
</div>

A scope is created in a similar way under `Client Scopes` > `Create`.  
We will not show a consent screen, so you can uncheck this option.

<div style="text-align: center;" >
  <img class="image fit-contain" src="{{ '/img/securing-web-applications-with-keycloak/create_scope.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="80%" />
</div>

Now add the scope to the client we created earlier under `Clients` > `Client Scopes`.

<div style="text-align: center;" >
  <img class="image fit-contain" src="{{ '/img/securing-web-applications-with-keycloak/assign_scope.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="80%" />
</div>
<br>

## Creating a user

To use our application later, we need a user to log in with.
In most corporate environments, users are stored in Active Directory (AD) or LDAP.
Keycloak can connect to both AD and LDAP but for our example, we will simply create a user in Keycloak itself.  

Search for the `Users` tab in the menu on the left and click `Add User`.  

<div style="text-align: center;" >
  <img class="image fit-contain" src="{{ '/img/securing-web-applications-with-keycloak/create_user.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="60%" />
</div>

Check `Email Verified` as we do not have email configured on our Keycloak server.  
After creation, you still have to set a password.
Go to the Credentials tab and enter a new one.

<div style="text-align: center;" >
  <img class="image fit-contain" src="{{ '/img/securing-web-applications-with-keycloak/create_user_password.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="40%" />
</div>

> Make sure the password is not a temporary one. 

If you created a new role in the previous section, you can assign it to your user under the `Role Mappings` tab.

That's all for the Keycloak part.
Now let's look at some applications to secure.

# Setting up the Front End and Back End Applications

The demo setup will consist of:
* an Angular SPA project 
* a Spring Boot application to serve some data

## Spring Boot Back End

You can clone the base setup [here](https://github.com/jmeys/heroes-api){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and switch to the `unsecured` branch.
It is a very simple application which serves some heroes on `/api/heroes` and `/api/heroes/{id}` on port 9090.

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.CrossOrigin;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@CrossOrigin("*")
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/heroes")
public class HeroController {

    private List<Hero> someHeroes = List.of(
            new Hero(1, "Ken"),
            new Hero(2, "Yannick"),
            new Hero(3, "Pieter"));

    @GetMapping
    public List<Hero> heroes() {
        return someHeroes;
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public Hero hero(@PathVariable("id") String id) {
        return someHeroes.stream()
                .filter(h -> Integer.toString(h.getId()).equals(id))
                .findFirst()
                .orElse(null);
    }
}

class Hero {
    private final int id;
    private final String name;

    public Hero(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getId() { return id; }

    public String getName() { return name; }
}
```

For this example, every application may request these resources, hence the `@CrossOrigin("*")`.
Open the project in your favourite IDE and run it. 
The application will run on port 9090.

## Angular App: Tour of Heroes

[Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/tutorial){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} is the Angular tutorial application. 
It's pretty simple but has all the basic components which make up a modern Angular application. 
And most importantly, it's kept up to date with the latest version of Angular. 

Use these commands or [download](https://angular.io/generated/zips/toh-pt6/toh-pt6.zip){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} the latest version of the Tour Of Heroes application from [the website](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt6){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

```bash
$ curl -LO https://angular.io/generated/zips/toh-pt6/toh-pt6.zip
$ unzip toh-pt6.zip -d toh
$ cd toh
$ npm i
```

The example app uses an in-memory service to return some heroes. 
Since you'll want to serve them from Spring Boot instead, change the url in `hero.service.ts` from `"api/heroes"` into `"http://localhost:9090/api/heroes"`.  

```typescript
export class HeroService {

  private heroesUrl = 'http://localhost:9090/api/heroes';
  ...
}
```

It will still try to fetch preloaded heroes from memory, so delete the `HttpClientInMemoryWebApiModule` from `app.module.ts`.

Now you can run the application with

```bash
$ ng serve
```

and browse to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} to see if it works.

> Please note that not all functionality of the app is working because - for brevity - we only implemented the GET functionality in the Spring Boot back end.

# Implementing Security
We will now dive into the interesting part: setting up the security of the applications.
To understand this section, you should have a basic understanding of OAuth 2.0 and OIDC. 
If this is not yet the case, this section might be more difficult to understand. 
You can fast-forward to the next section or start your journey by watching this awesome video by [Nate Barbettini](https://twitter.com/nbarbettini){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} from [Okta](https://www.okta.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

<div class="responsive-video">
    <iframe width="1164" height="655" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/996OiexHze0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<br>

## Implicit Flow versus Code Flow + PKCE
In this example, we will use the authorization code grant flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange ([PKCE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} to secure the Angular app. 
It's a very long name for what could be shortened to "code flow + PKCE" which is [more secure than the implicit flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-13#section-3.1.2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.   
In fact, the implicit flow was never very secure to begin with. 
This is well-explained by [Nate Barbettini](https://twitter.com/nbarbettini){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Aaron Parecki](https://twitter.com/aaronpk):{:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

<div class="responsive-video">
    <iframe width="1164" height="655" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHzERullHe8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<br>

The implicit flow was the easiest to understand, since it required one step less than the standard code flow:

<div style="text-align: center;" >
  <img class="image fit-contain" src="{{ '/img/securing-web-applications-with-keycloak/implicit_vs_code.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="60%" />
</div>

PKCE is an addition on top of the standard code flow to make it usable for public clients. 
It is already in use for native and mobile clients. 
PKCE boils down to this: 
1. Give `hash` of random value to authorization server when logging in to ask for `code`
2. Hand over the `random value` to authorization server when exchanging `code` for `access token`
3. Authorization server returns `access token` after verifying that `hash` belongs to `random value`.

<div style="text-align: center;" >
  <img class="image fit-contain" src="{{ '/img/securing-web-applications-with-keycloak/pkce.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="70%" />
</div>

If a fraudster were to intercept our authorization grant (the code), he or she would still not have the `code_verifier`, which is stored in our SPA client. 
If he/she tries to exchange the stolen authorization grant without this value, the response would not be a token but rather an `HTTP 400`:

```json
{
    "error": "invalid_grant",
    "error_description": "PKCE code verifier not specified"
}
```

This is why the code flow + PKCE is more secure than the implicit flow. 
Even if an attacker manages to obtain the authorization grant, it's worthless without the `code_verifier`.

> Note that the HTTP 400 will only occur when using PKCE. 
If no PKCE is used, the client should be confidential (requiring credentials to exchange the authorization grant) rather than be public.

So only our Angular client will be able to retrieve the access token in the form of a JSON Web Token.

## JSON Web Token (JWT)
JSON Web Tokens or JWT, often pronounced as 'jot', is an open standard for a compact way of representing data to be transferred between two parties. 
What this means is that it's a special kind of object which has some data in it. It can also be digitally signed to make sure it is not tampered with.

In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:

* `Header`:  the type of the token and the signing algorithm being used
* `Payload`: the payload, which contains the claims and additional data
* `Signature`: to verify if the token was not tampered with

Therefore, a JWT typically looks like the following:

```
xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz
```

The header (xxx) and payload (yyy) are base64 encoded. 
An access token is a good example of a JWT:

```
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSldUIiwia2lkIiA6ICJkdE9JZkY2NGZRYnlwWVRFdGV2eV83NUdIWTdQMmNHU1o2a2ZXWDdFblBJIn0.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.cvn79d-n0aFYqDB3p-htDNeeYOdkvqEsmDhGKp9V3a4i6nJx7dU0_r7zicQe26ZgDsM65ILx_X-buWv-e5_eraFo1OOveCGtBbrrLwrQ0Z7SlVMHJrDooJrLEE_m8Qlz_-iLcEC2-ODroEwyLRej_Du626B48QL2bcq-8ADqGSaLf7Y4ZTVMiP_p6dsCi4GDQLq1WOy-g6--z47FKTJVuAl2yY_JNNuEd5aofw0FTE38EoEinIdcy5NXCXDhtGHr_k5lA2Swu4JvK84YB6usECigCb1_zO_c6LhZQkRTCcCojxC6Qn1trQH9epcFEKTkDCHrNf6BLp4X9rH2URWJcA
```

We can easily decode them using online tools like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

<div style="text-align: center;" >
  <img class="image fit-contain" src="{{ '/img/securing-web-applications-with-keycloak/jwt.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="70%" />
</div>

The payload section can have different kinds of data. 
Since our tokens are used for OAuth and OIDC, they have all kinds of claims, which are key-value statements about an entity. 
You can compare this to something like a coupon. A coupon has claims about how much it is worth, which product(s) it applies to and when it expires.  

In our example token there is a claim that `name` is `Jeroen Meys` and also that `scope` is `email profile heroes`. 
This scope claim means we can use this token to know my email, some profile info and whatever heroes is needed for (hint: keep on reading to find out!). 
If you are interested in other JWT use-cases, you should definitely give [Using JWT for State Transfer](https://ordina-jworks.github.io/microservices/2016/05/01/Using-JWT-Tokens-for-State-Transfer.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} a read.

> Be careful with online tools to analyze JWT tokens. You are exposing access tokens to the world!

Now that we understand what an access token is and looks like, we can pass it along to the back end which will be configured as a stateless OAuth Resource Server.

## Resource Server in Spring Boot
Resource server is the OAuth 2.0 terminology for API server. 
It will look at our access token and decide if we are allowed to perform the requested API action.  
What we really want to secure is the data served by our Spring Boot app.
We don't want the villains out there to be able to access our list of heroes, do we?

Let's take care of that.

While Keycloak provides its [own libraries](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/tree/master/adapters/oidc){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} to be used with Spring Boot, I personally favour more generic libraries that are provider unaware. 
This is in line with the [Spring framework design philosophy](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/overview.html#overview-philosophy) of deferring design decisions as late as possible.
This way, when we feel like it, we can more easily switch from one solution (Keycloak) to another (eg. Okta), as long as they support the OIDC protocol. 
The de facto standard for securing Spring Boot applications is Spring Boot Security. 
It has resource server support, so this is what we'll be using.

### Resource Server Imports
Let's add the dependecies to our `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
dependencies {
	...
	implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security'
	implementation 'org.springframework.security:spring-security-oauth2-resource-server'
	implementation 'org.springframework.security:spring-security-oauth2-jose'
}
```

* `spring-boot-starter-security`: starter dependency for Spring Security
* `spring-security-oauth2-resource-server`: dependency to use our application as a Resource Server
* `spring-security-oauth2-jose`: support for the Javascript Object Signing and Encryption framework

### Configuration of the Resource Server
Then all we have to do is some configuring.

```java
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class ResourceServerConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.cors().and()
                .authorizeRequests()
                .mvcMatchers("/api/heroes/**").hasAuthority("SCOPE_heroes")
                .anyRequest().denyAll()
                .and()
                .oauth2ResourceServer()
                .jwt();
    }

}
```

With these few lines of code, a lot is happening. We told Spring Security that all endpoints are forbidden, except for `/api/heroes/**` when the heroes scope is present. This will be checked against the JWT access token.

The `oauth2ResourceServer()` sets up the application as a resource server. It will check if there is an access token on every request and whether it is valid or not. 
In order to verify that a token hasn't been tampered with, we need some information from Keycloak, which it exposes via a REST endpoint.

We add the endpoint to our `application.properties`:

```properties
server.port=9090
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.jwk-set-uri=http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/heroes/protocol/openid-connect/certs
```

### Testing the setup

That's all for the resource server part.
Don't forget to restart the Spring Boot application after these changes!

We can use curl to verify if our security is working correctly.

```bash
$ curl -i http://localhost:9090/api/heroes
HTTP/1.1 401
Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=A2268A4D12924631929BEBDA57CB2333; Path=/; HttpOnly
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Content-Length: 0
Date: Sun, 18 Aug 2019 21:15:14 GMT
```

Without a token, the server responds with HTTP 401. 
This means we are not authorized. 
As we don't have a login form available just yet, we can use the Direct Access Grants flow to obtain a token. 
This can come in very handy for testing different scenarios as well.

```bash
$export TOKEN=$(curl -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "client_id=spa-heroes" \
  -d "username=jeroen" \
  -d "password=1234" \
  -d "grant_type=password" \
  -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/heroes/protocol/openid-connect/token | jq -r .access_token)
$echo $TOKEN
eyJhbGciOeUNvcWVJVWxNIn0.eyJqdGkiOiI......Hnz5aFdcAiB-5o-yep6rcGP_H6yQoW
```

> Make sure 'Direct Access Grants Enabled' is enabled in the Keycloak Client settings

We can now use this token to request the resource once more:

```bash
$ curl -i -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:9090/api/heroes
HTTP/1.1 200
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Sun, 18 Aug 2019 21:25:36 GMT

[{"id":1,"name":"Ken"},{"id":2,"name":"Yannick"},{"id":3,"name":"Pieter"}]
```

This time we got the requested resource back from the server!

## Securing The Angular application

When we now look at our Tour Of Heroes application again, it's complaining a bit:

```
HeroService: getHeroes failed: Http failure response for http://localhost:9090/api/heroes: 401 OK
```

We didn't log in (HTTP 401), so we can't see the content. Time to fix it!  

There are many packages we could use to secure our Angular app. An easy one to get started with, is [angular-oauth2-oidc](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} from Manfred Steyer but you could use any library, as long as it's [certified by OpenID](https://openid.net/certification/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

Add it to the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm i angular-oauth2-oidc --save
```

Then add it to the imports of `app.module.ts`

```typescript
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
import { OAuthModule } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    ...
    HttpClientModule,
    OAuthModule.forRoot({
      resourceServer: {
          allowedUrls: ['http://localhost:9090/api'],
          sendAccessToken: true
      }
  })
```

Notice how we configure `localhost:9090/api` to be the only URL where we will send our access token to.  


Next up, let's add log in and log out buttons in `app.component.html`.

```html
<button class="btn btn-default" (click)="login()">
  Login
</button>
<button class="btn btn-default" (click)="logoff()">
  Logout
</button>
```

Now all there is left to do is to configure the `OAuthService`. We do this in `app.component.ts`:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { OAuthService, NullValidationHandler, AuthConfig } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';
import { JwksValidationHandler } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Tour of Heroes';
  
  constructor(private oauthService: OAuthService) {
    this.configure();
  }

  authConfig: AuthConfig = {
    issuer: 'http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/heroes',
    redirectUri: window.location.origin + "/heroes",
    clientId: 'spa-heroes',
    scope: 'openid profile email offline_access heroes',
    responseType: 'code',
    // at_hash is not present in JWT token
    disableAtHashCheck: true,
    showDebugInformation: true
  }
  
  public login() {
    this.oauthService.initLoginFlow();
  }
  
  public logoff() {
    this.oauthService.logOut();
  }
  
  private configure() {
    this.oauthService.configure(this.authConfig);
    this.oauthService.tokenValidationHandler = new NullValidationHandler();
    this.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocumentAndTryLogin();
  }
}
```

Make sure that the name of the realm (heroes) and the client id (spa-heroes) correspond to the ones you defined in Keycloak. 
Remember how we required the heroes scope to be present in our back end? The scope property is how we fix this. 
If we omit `heroes` from the scope list, we will be getting a 403 response from our resource server.

> Keycloak is not returning the `at_hash` claim in the access token. For this reason, the client library would crash while parsing it.
This is why we disable it in the config but also use the `NullValidationHandler` instead of the `JwksValidationHandler` as it would also make the application crash.

We can now try to log in and if all went well, we should see our heroes appear again when browsing to `/dashboard` or `/heroes`.

> Don't worry if you do not immediatly see the heroes appear. This is because we load the `/heroes` page before our code was exchanged for an access token.
This results in the first `/heroes` call getting a 401 response. You can create a new endpoint and use it as the redirectUri to get rid of this problem.

# Conclusion
We set up a Keycloak server and covered how we can secure a Spring Boot API by turning it into a resource server. 
We then discussed why the authorization grant flow + PKCE replaces the implicit flow and how to implement it in an Angular application.
