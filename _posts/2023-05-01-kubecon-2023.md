JWorks at Kubecon 2023
{: refdef}

Another year, another KubeCon | CloudNativeCon edition. 
And of course, JWorks was also present at this year's edition in Amsterdam in the [RAI](https://www.rai.nl/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
We wanted to hear more about all the new features, frameworks, tools, ideas, concepts that the Kubernetes and cloud world has to offer.
And we got what we wanted.
We attended a lot of interesting talks, talked to very intriguing people at the event and had a lot of fun while doing so.
Next to the talks, there were also a lot of booths from companies from all over the world (AWS, Azure, Canonical, ...) to engage with other people and to talk and promote their newest products for the developer market.
With that being said, you can take a look at some of the talks we attended which we thought were very interesting.

# Metrics at Full Throttle: Intro and Deep Dive Into Thanos - Saswata Mukherjee & Filip Petkovski, Shopify

[Thanos](https://thanos.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} enables a highly available Prometheus setup.
It replaces parts of the Prometheus deployment model that are hard to scale with regular Prometheus. 

This talk is a great introduction to Thanos.
Saswata and Filip start by explaining what difficulties you can have with scaling a regular Prometheus setup. 
They explain what components of Thanos solve the different issues with scaling Prometheus. 
The following components of Thanos are introduced: Sidecar, Ruler, Receive, Query, Compactor and Store gateway.

Where the first half of the talk is mainly targeted towards people who don't know Thanos or don't know all capabilities of Thanos yet, the second half was surely targeted towards experienced Thanos users.
In the second half of the talk, Saswata and Filip highlight recent, since the KubeCon Detroit, improvements to Thanos.

They discuss 5 new features in Thanos. 
The first boils down to optimizations to the store gateway to remove the high IO requirements to run the store gateway.
The new store gateway implementation doesn't require the high IO disk anymore as the information is stored in memory instead of on disk. 

Three new features were announced to optimize the querying throughout the different components in Thanos.

First, quality of service limits were added as Thanos configuration options. 
This allows teams managing Thanos to define the limits to tune the Thanos performance and prevent a single query from overloading the system.

The second improvement related to query performance was a newly implemented, Thanos-specific, PromQL engine. 
With the new query engine, the query will be analyzed up front and an optimal (parallel!) execution will be determined. 
Since not all operators are supported yet, the new engine will be used when possible with a fallback to the standard Prometheus PromQL engine when needed.

The third improvement is the distributed execution of queries.
This mechanism allows queries to be executed by the nodes that have direct access to the needed data, preventing costly data transfers between components in the Thanos architecture. 
If you want more information on this amazing feature, definitely check out this talk when it's available on YouTube!

A new hash ring mechanism was implemented for the Receiver to prevent overloading single Receiver instances. 

They end by showing real-world performance graphs from a Thanos deployment and how different versions of Thanos caused visible improvements.

# Automating Configuration and Permissions Testing for GitOps with OPA Conftest - Eve Ben Ezra & Michael Hume, The New York Times

Open Policy Agent is a tool to add [policy based control to cloud native environments](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
OPA is used in many different tools and systems as a system to validate configuration before it's deployed to cloud environments. 

In this talk, Eve and Michel explain how OPA is used in the New York Times internal developer platform to control what their developers deploy.
Eve starts by showing what problems they experienced at the New York Times with allowing developers to use the internal platform. 
As with all validation (aka testing) mechanisms, shifting left is the focus. 
They continue to explain how [Conftest](https://www.conftest.dev/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} helped them in providing feedback to the developer as soon as they write a single line of code.
Validating the configuration using the same definition along every set in the process, makes it very transparent to developers where issues are introduced and what they can do to fix them. 

Next, a great introduction to OPAs rule language Rego is shown by Eve.
They take the audience through a complete example, explaining what is defined and how it's interpreted, including the quirks, using Rego. 

Finally, Michel shows how [Kubeconform](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} can be used to help with Kubernetes version migrations, including CRDs. 
They show a real example and explain how the output of the tool can be used to quickly identify what's wrong with a manifest.

If anything, this talk is a brilliant introduction to Rego.
If you have an interest in policy management in your Kubernetes cluster or if you have experienced hard to find bugs in Kubernetes manifests, this is a must-watch talk from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

# Sponsers / Vendors / Projects with stands

## AWS

AWS had an impressive presence, offering attendees a wide range of experiences and insights into their latest developments. The AWS stand provided a sneak peek of upcoming features and integrations planned for their EKS portal. The visuals on display highlighted their focus on monitoring and improving the overall user experience.

In addition to the exciting demos, AWS provided a fun and challenging mini-golf game for conference-goers to play. Participants had the opportunity to win AWS-branded pyjama pants, adding a touch of fun and excitement to the event.

AWS didn't stop at the game, as they also offered an array of other goodies for attendees throughout the conference. Whether it was swag bags, or other branded merchandise, AWS had something for everyone.

Finally, AWS brought a team of experts who were available to answer any questions attendees had about EKS. Their knowledgeable team provided attendees with valuable insights and guidance on using the platform effectively.
