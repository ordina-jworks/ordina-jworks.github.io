JWorks at Kubecon 2023
{: refdef}

Another year, another KubeCon | CloudNativeCon edition. 
And of course, JWorks was also present at this year's edition in Amsterdam in the [RAI](https://www.rai.nl/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
We wanted to hear more about all the new features, frameworks, tools, ideas, concepts that the Kubernetes and cloud world has to offer.
And we got what we wanted.
We attended a lot of interesting talks, talked to very intriguing people at the event and had a lot of fun while doing so.
Next to the talks, there were also a lot of booths from companies from all over the world (AWS, Azure, Canonical, ...) to engage with other people and to talk and promote their newest products for the developer market.
With that being said, you can take a look at some of the talks we attended which we thought were very interesting.

# Metrics at Full Throttle: Intro and Deep Dive Into Thanos - Saswata Mukherjee & Filip Petkovski, Shopify

[Thanos](https://thanos.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} enables a highly available Prometheus setup.
It replaces parts of the Prometheus deployment model that are hard to scale with regular Prometheus. 

This talk is a great introduction to Thanos.
Saswata and Filip start by explaining what difficulties you can have with scaling a regular Prometheus setup. 
They explain what components of Thanos solve the different issues with scaling Prometheus. 
The following components of Thanos are introduced: Sidecar, Ruler, Receive, Query, Compactor and Store gateway.

Where the first half of the talk is mainly targeted towards people who don't know Thanos or don't know all capabilities of Thanos yet, the second half was surely targeted towards experienced Thanos users.
In the second half of the talk, Saswata and Filip highlight recent, since the KubeCon Detroit, improvements to Thanos.

They discuss 5 new features in Thanos. 
The first boils down to optimizations to the store gateway to remove the high IO requirements to run the store gateway.
The new store gateway implementation doesn't require the high IO disk anymore as the information is stored in memory instead of on disk. 

Three new features were announced to optimize the querying throughout the different components in Thanos.

First, quality of service limits were added as Thanos configuration options. 
This allows teams managing Thanos to define the limits to tune the Thanos performance and prevent a single query from overloading the system.

The second improvement related to query performance was a newly implemented, Thanos-specific, PromQL engine. 
With the new query engine, the query will be analyzed up front and an optimal (parallel!) execution will be determined. 
Since not all operators are supported yet, the new engine will be used when possible with a fallback to the standard Prometheus PromQL engine when needed.

The third improvement is the distributed execution of queries.
This mechanism allows queries to be executed by the nodes that have direct access to the needed data, preventing costly data transfers between components in the Thanos architecture. 
If you want more information on this amazing feature, definitely check out this talk when it's available on YouTube!

A new hash ring mechanism was implemented for the Receiver to prevent overloading single Receiver instances. 

They end by showing real-world performance graphs from a Thanos deployment and how different versions of Thanos caused visible improvements.

# [PlayStation and Kubernetes: How to Solve a Problem Like Real-Time - Joseph Irving, PlayStation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pklRTQoRrNY){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

Since its birth in 1994, (Sony) PlayStation has been a global pioneer in the gaming industry.
As PlayStation grew, their infrastructure needed to grow as well.
Over time, PlayStation had to scale their game servers so that they could handle their demand.
This had to be done in a way where game servers could be scaled in a compatible way with the game clients.
This means that simply spinning up more instances of the game server might not always work.

This talk, presented by Joseph Irving, went over the kind of problems they faced, different types of real-time game servers and their advantages and limitations (peer-to-peer, dedicated game servers, etc.).

Their solution was to use a project called [Agones](https://agones.dev/site/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, which is created and maintained by Google in collaboration with Ubisoft.
Agones is an open source platform which provides a native way of running game servers on Kubernetes without worrying about the infrastructure.
It provides compatibility with game server connections by using GameServers and connecting those GameServers with Fleets.
Joseph introduces the Agones framework and talks about how they use it and how it helped them to scale their gaming servers and to provide multi-regional operability.

He concludes the talk by talking about Matchmakers, which implements matchmaking (finding matches for people that are searching for a lobby in a game) through Kubernetes.

# Automating Configuration and Permissions Testing for GitOps with OPA Conftest - Eve Ben Ezra & Michael Hume, The New York Times

Open Policy Agent is a tool to add [policy based control to cloud native environments](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
OPA is used in many different tools and systems as a system to validate configuration before it's deployed to cloud environments. 

In this talk, Eve and Michel explain how OPA is used in the New York Times internal developer platform to control what their developers deploy.
Eve starts by showing what problems they experienced at the New York Times with allowing developers to use the internal platform. 
As with all validation (aka testing) mechanisms, shifting left is the focus. 
They continue to explain how [Conftest](https://www.conftest.dev/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} helped them in providing feedback to the developer as soon as they write a single line of code.
Validating the configuration using the same definition along every set in the process, makes it very transparent to developers where issues are introduced and what they can do to fix them. 

Next, a great introduction to OPAs rule language Rego is shown by Eve.
They take the audience through a complete example, explaining what is defined and how it's interpreted, including the quirks, using Rego. 

Finally, Michel shows how [Kubeconform](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} can be used to help with Kubernetes version migrations, including CRDs. 
They show a real example and explain how the output of the tool can be used to quickly identify what's wrong with a manifest.

If anything, this talk is a brilliant introduction to Rego.
If you have an interest in policy management in your Kubernetes cluster or if you have experienced hard to find bugs in Kubernetes manifests, this is a must-watch talk from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

# State of the Mop: Cloud Custodian in 2023

During the presentation, Kapil Thangavelu provided a concise update on [Cloud Custodian](https://cloudcustodian.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, an open-source rules engine designed for account and resource management on AWS, Azure, and GCP, based on the Rego language. Cloud Custodian can effectively scale from small businesses to large enterprises.

Since Kubecon Detroit in October 2022, Cloud Custodian has added support for two new providers. Additionally, they've included Terraform support to enable users to check their Terraform source code while running inside a pipeline.

Looking ahead, Cloud Custodian's roadmap for the current year includes adding a new K8s admission controller, support for AWS CloudFormation, preventative support for AWS, and an improved authoring experience through the addition of policy testing, policy tracing, a policy debugger, and more.

Cloud Custodian's open-source nature, flexibility, and upcoming roadmap make it a tool to watch for organizations managing cloud resources. It provides a powerful and customizable way to improve security, cost optimization, and compliance across different cloud providers.
