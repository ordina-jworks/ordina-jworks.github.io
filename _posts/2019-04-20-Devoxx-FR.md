## The Speakers dinner
The evening of the workshop day we had the speakers dinner which took us into the ... hotel.
Where we provided with lots yummy snacks to feast one while enjoying a glass wine.
It is a great opportunity to network with the other speakers, an opportunity to connect with other experienced developers and gain valuable isnights.

That is the power of a conference, to speak with other attendees and speakers and gain valuable knowledge.
But most of that knowledge is not presented in the talks but will only bubble up if you speak face 2 face.

## Applying (D)DDD and CQ(R)S to Cloud Architectures with Java, Spring Boot, Kafka and Docker by [Benjamin Nothdurft](https://twitter.com/DataDuke){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Benjamin Nothdurft" src="/img/devoxx-ma-2018/speaker-benjamin-nothdurft.png"></span>
Benjamin started off by giving a brief introduction on Domain-Driven Design explaining the different building blocks such as domains, domain events, ubiquitous language and Event Storming.  
He also mentioned the famous two books: [Domain-Driven Design by Eric Evans](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/domain-driven-design-tackling/0321125215/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Implementing Domain-Driven Design by Vaugn Vernon](https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0321834577){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

Benjamin went through all the different steps of Event Storming.
The goal is to bring people of different silos together, such as developers, analysts, architects and business experts.
Together you want to create a logically ordered sequence of events to document a system using an ubiquitous language i.e. everybody using the same vocabulary and terms.
Events describe things that have happened and are thus always in the past tense e.g. product added to cart.
In a next step you want to identify commands, which are the triggers of events e.g. add product to cart.
There are also aggregates which represent the data that is interacted with.
And finally you want to identify the bounded contexts grouping relevant parts together.

Benjamin then explained how this all gets translated to your system architecture.
Each bounded context can be mapped to a single microservice.
He covered different context map patterns such as event publisher, shared kernel, customer/supplier and anti-corruption layer together with detailed code samples.
Afterwards he went through a CQRS example with many code samples and the questions you should be asking yourself when determining the right architecture.
We really liked how in-depth everything was as many presentations about Domain-Driven Design usually remain rather abstract and high-level.

## Modern Java: Change is the Only Constant by [Mark Reinhold](https://twitter.com/mreinhold){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
Monolithic platform (JDK) that got sliced up into modules and how they did it.
Leads to smaller packages of your application.
Makes it more secure as well thanks to stronger encapsulation.
A couple of Zero Day exploits could have been avoided with stronger encapsulation.
Restrict access to internal packages, it will no longer compile and it may generate warning at runtime.
From releases of several years to releases of every 6 months.

$ jdeps --jdk-internals app.jar
Check if internal APIs are used

In theory, if your code only uses standard Java SE EAPIs that it will. most likely work without changes.
More info, see: jeps/291

Java.se.ee and corba modules were removed in Java 11.
Costly to maintain, source of vulnerabilities.
Other obscure methods were removed in Java 9 such as a couple of add/removePropertyChangeListeners
lots of methods in SecurityManager

To be removed:
Some methods in java.util.zip, java.security,…
Lots of older methods that are not really that interesting any more.

JDK 9: 90 JEPs
6 JEPs came from outside Oracle

JDK 10: 12 JEPs
2 JEPs from other contributors (304, 316)

JDK 11: 17 JEPs
3 JEPs from others (315, 318, 331)
2458 issues resolved (1963 solved by Oracle, 169 by SAP and others)
LTE (next one will be JDK 17)

JDK 12: 8 JEPs
1 JEPs from other contributor (189)

Every release is PRD ready, only difference is support time.

“Java is still free.”
Quote Andrew Haley: “Finally, please let me assure you of one thing: whether by Oracle or
Red Hat or someone else, JDK LTS releases will continue to be
supported. We all have a lot invested in Java, and we won't let it
fall.”
source: http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk-dev/2018-August/001826.html

Oracle JDK vs OpenJDK
Choose between LTS version and big upgrade migrations or latest release with small migrations every 6 months.
Feature release: Make sure your tools and dependencies can keep up!

4 reasons not to worry about it
- advanced notice before removing anything (@Deprecated (…))
- Make the choose yourself between LTS or feature releases
- Java is still free
- Some things might break but it shouldn’t take much work to fix them

Asked on Twitter to library maintainers if they worked fine on JDK9, same question was asked when JDK 11 got released.
A lot of libraries were already upgraded for JDK 11.

If you’r eusing Java 9 or lateer, upgrade to the latest version of your tools and other dependencies.
“Everything changes and nothing stands still Heraclitus”

Important things when working on new version:
- Developer productivity
- Program performance
- In the case of constantly evolving programming paradigms, application areas, deployment styles and hardware

Amber: Right-sizing languages ceremony (reducing boilerplate)
- Better and improved type inference with a smarter compiler
- Less keyboard typing for you
- Fix error prone things such as switch case on enums with pattern matching where the compiler detects whether a default is needed or not
- Multi-line strings (Java 13 JEP TBD)
- Value classes for data containers: record Point(double x, double y)
Loom: Fibers
- Similar to threads but different
    - Fibers are simpler than threads
    - Fibers work well with CompletableFutures
- Gave a demo on the performance
Valhalla: Value types & specialized generics
- No time to cover these

## Meet Micronaut: a reactive microservices framework for the JVM by [Álvaro Sánchez-Mariscal](https://twitter.com/alvaro_sanchez){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
Reality of existing frameworks
- Frameworks based on reflection and annotations tend to become fat
- But we love the programming model and productivity model so we live with it
- So… why should we be more efficient?

What Spring and Jakarta EE do
Spring is an amazing technical achievement but many things are done at runttime
- reads the byte code of every bean it finds
- synthesize new annotations on each bean method, constructor,… to support annotation metadata
This leads to high startup time and memory consumption

Micronaut is a new framework created by the creators of Grails.
Goal: to have the productivity of spring boot/grails with the performance of a compile-time, non-blocking framework.
It is designed from the groud up with microservices and cloud in mind.
Ultra lightweight and reactive (based on netty instead of tomcat)
Internals are reactive 
Integrated AOP and compile-time DI for Java, Groovy and Kotlin
Annotation processors for Java and Jotlin
AST transformations for Groovy

Open Source (TODO: at link to the repo)
It wqs announced 1 year ago, in may 2018. after 2 years of development behind the scene.

Build:
- Microservices
- Serverless applications
- Message-driven applications with kafka/rabbit
- CLI applications
- Android applications
- Simple static void main(String.. args) things

Micronaut can be even faster with GraalVM, but this still is experimental though.

Next Alvaro showed use a Coding demo:
Micronaut project with Consul for service discovery
Greeting application with tests
52ms to start with Consul registration (with GraalVM?)
Multiple instances of the same microservicee
Second application created for the gateway
Has reactive types such as Single, non blocking, similar to a future
Wrote a non-blocking api in the gateway that merges two calls to the greeting application

Another demo of an application on Google Cloud Run (serverless based on containers)
Google cloud run was preferred over AWS by the speaker.

## Full-Text Search Tips & Tricks by [Denis Rosa](https://twitter.com/deniswsrosa){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
Developer advocate at Couchbase
Bleve: full-text search and indexing for Go

Search is not about matching text
Search is more sales-oriented

Netflix: convince you to watch.a movie
Google: answer your question

How do users search?
1 word, 2 words, 3 words, …
User queries should be saved (don’t forget to do so)

TD/IDF: rare words score higher
Edit distance: minimum number of operations required to transform on estring into the other: ex. star -> start
Pivoted length norm

Example with Bleve underneath
Couchflix: specify text to search on movies
star war vs star wars (first one showed zombie movies over star wars…)
Multiple searches were made to see the difference: match on title alone, match on title, description, etc
Star and war were still being matched separately
We need to use Shingle:
“Star wars daisy Ridley”
Star Wars
Wars Daisy
Daisy Ridley

Stemming
Fishing, fished -> fish

Boosting: Ranking factors
Need to think about them…
Types
Standard
Signals
Personalisations
Important to plan your ranking factors and weights

Decay functions
Eg: leave out older movies that are less relevant

Plan your business rules
Eg: promote movie x

Things also get more complicated when we want to search on an actor name…
Searches are always biased, so the one we had for titles is less ideal for searching on actors.

Pitfalls
For tests, the Cranfield Evaluation Method is a good strategy to implement tests
Use precision and recall as a metric
Check out the text retrieval course on Coursera

Be careful with features that are directly influenced by users to avoid being tricked!

## Real Quantum Computing by [James Birnie](https://twitter.com/runningchairjb){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
Using many worlds to solve the unsolvable

Why quantum computing?
James didn’t knew anything about it until he followed a talk of Alistair in Vienna at which point he still found it hard to comprehend.
So, he decided to make a talk of his exploration of quantum computing inn such a way that it would become easier to comprehend for the uninitiated.

The last version of the tech radar has [Q#](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} in Assess on the recommendation of James.

To understand, first classical bit:
bit = unit of binary information
can hold 2 states: 0 or 1
Stored as one of two voltages
Logic gates compose into arithmetic.

in quantum computing: Qubit
also value 0 or 1
observing the value “collapses” the state to a single value
Any quantum thing can be a qubit, such as ean electron, a photon or an ion

The quantum state - the bloch sphere
A complex values probability amplitude
Probabilities of measuring the different values are derived from the quantum state
This maps to a point on the bloch sphere for a single qubit in a pure state

Quantum logic gates
like classical logic gates they

IBM Q
Can make a free account to play with quantum computers
Make circuits by drag and dropping gates and operations

Schrodinger’s cat thought experiment demonstrated
When executed on a real quantum computer there were a lot of error states, showing that quantum computers are not yet prd ready.
In a simulation the result was balanced in the 00000 and 01111 state.

There are problems that classical computing cannot solve but quantum computers can and this is what makes them interesting.
Quantum computers cannot meaningfully persist state though.
Hardware is not ready yet for quantum computers and they are hard to program.

Did an experiment on his own cat and the different states of a cat.
Wrote a program on the behaviour of cats.
C# program CatMoodExperiment with. multiple outcomes: x people feeding the cat
4 qubits representing 4 persons, that may feed the cat
Another test that represents how the cat is feeling
Available on his github

What do we need to build a commercial quantum solution?
- alogrithms and applications (will happen)
- integration with cloud provider (will happen)
- error correction (hard!)
- quantum classic interface (hard!)
- cryogenic systems (expensive!!)
- scalable qubit foundations (hard!)

Young’s double slit: light traveling in waves, right?
Later on it was discovered that light travels in particles, photons that have neergy and momentum

Quantum algorithms
- Deutsch - Josza algorithm, 1992
- Grover’s algorithm, 1996

Quantum fourer transform

Quantum chemistry
Haber-Bosch process for nitrogen fixation

Shor’s algorithm to factorise n
To break RSA encryption
Currently still not there

## Agile is a Dirty Word by [James Birnie](https://twitter.com/runningchairjb){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

In this talk James explores in which organizations agile became a dirty word.

Often it starts with companies who are doing real agile, you can compare the organizations with real democratic countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Doing agile does not make you agile, you don't do agile, you are.

Often it is like a cargo cult, just doing the rituals of scrum but loosing the goal, the context out of sight.

Combine this with risk management theater, aka lots of processes and checkboxed to tick in order to avoid risk taking and it is easy for agile to become a dirty word.

SAFE is the perfect example of agile gone wrong, too much convention and control.

Agile also tends to collide with the current issues with budgeting, which tend to emphasize on short-term goals preventing organizations from doing some real investments.

A good paper to read is: [How to detect agile bullshit](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Oct/09/2002049591/-1/-1/0/DIB_DETECTING_AGILE_BS_2018.10.05.PDF){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}from the us department of defence.

In order to bring the organization back to track, avoid dirty words.
Read the agile manifesto and talk about the values and principles mentioned.

Note, waste is not always obvious, like code reviews which are often seen als helpfull and agile, but too often are just waste.

Only work on your biggest problem, and only when that has been tackled move over to the next.

The goal of agile should be to get autonomous cross functional teams who can deliver themselves and are decoupled as much as possible from the rest of the organization.

Also, there does not exist failure within agile, it is better to call it experimenting.

## Conclusion
Devoxx FR was amazing experience for us where we got to meet and befriend a lot of great people.

Because that should be the main goal when you attend a conference, share your experiences.
I admit, that as a speaker it is easier to share your experience, to get in contact with other people.
But as an attendee you should never hesitate to go up to a speaker or another attendee and ask a question, to come in contact.
Most people are happy and willingly to share their knowledge.

So if the next time you are at a conference and you are thinking about that you would like to ask a question or join a conversation, just do it.

The date for next year's edition has already been announced and will happen on 15 - 17 april 2020.
Be sure to mark it in your agenda!
