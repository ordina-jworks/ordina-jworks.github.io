[SATURN](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2017/) is the leading international conference for software architecture practitioners who look beyond the details of todayâ€™s technologies to the underlying trends, techniques and principles that underpin lasting success in our fast-moving field. 
SATURN offers a unique mix to learn, exchange ideas, and find collaborators at the leading edge of modern software architecture practice.

2017 marks the 13th edition of the SATURN conference, organised by the [Software Engineering Institute](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/) of [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/).
This edition was held at the Hilton Denver Inverness in Englewood, Colorado, set against the backdrop of the majestic Rocky Mountains.

# Pragmatic Architecture, Today

I was honoured to talk about [Pragmatic Archtecture](https://www.slideshare.net/BartBlommaerts/pragmatic-architecture-saturn-2017) at SATURN 2017. 
I had done this talk a couple of times at developer conferences, so I was very anxious to compare the feedback to certain statements at an architecture conference.
As it turns out, feedback was (surprisingly) similar:

* Architects nor developers are very fond of UML. 
Both emphasize the importance of communicating the architecture of a system to stakeholders, in a clear and understable manner.
* Virtually all architects have a developer background and want to be actively involved in code.
* Architects understand the necessity to play the political game. 
Developers might also understand this, but prefer not to participate in these, sometimes frustrating, discussions.

In general, I am very happy with this feedback and it shows that the two communities can (and have to) really work together nicely.

# Software is details ([Kevlin Henney](https://saturn2017.sched.com/volunteer/kevlin_henney.1wc9dtfw))

On the first day of SATURN 2017, Kevlin Henney presented a very interesting keynote on **details in software** stating that everything is a detail, depending on the level of abstraction of a certain problem.

> Geeks are people who love something so much that all the details matter.

And these details can be very important.
In Architecture, abstractions are necessary to focus on specific parts of a system.
Modern software systems are often too complex to grasp all at once so we restrict our attenton to a small number of the software system's structures.
To avoid the obvious discrepancy between abstraction and detail, Kevlin quoted [Tom Gilb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Gilb) stating that _Architecture is a hypothesis, that needs to be proven by implementation and measurement_.
This illustrates the importance of collaborating as a team.

We will need to make decisions, given our current understanding of a certain problem.
Implementing these decisions might lead to new beliefs and insights for the architecture. 
If a plot works out exactly as first planned, we might not be working loosely enough to give room to imagination and instincts.
This encourages looking at things from more than one point of view.
