# What is Technical Leadership
A Technical Lead has the responsibility to help the team move forwards. 
In general, the person assigned to the role, is someone who has sound technical experience and strong communication skills. 
He or she will be accountable for the technical direction of the project / product and serve as the go-to person for cross-team interactions.

</p>

When it comes to medium to large teams it is quite common to have a full-time Tech Lead present, responsible for important leadership activities such as

* Guiding the project technical vision. 
Eg. what technology are we going to use, how are we going to deliver the project, what patterns will we use, etc.
* Analyzing risks and cross-functional requirements.

	* Analysing risk obviously means mitigating risk: can we chose a certain approach or does it have too many unknowns.
	* What will the impact on the project be of taking a certain risk. 
	Eg. introducing a new technology you saw at a conference.

* Coaching less experienced people.
You most likely will have mixed experience in your team. 
This makes a lot of sense when it comes to cost of a project, mixing and matching skills and experience; thus educating less experienced people.
* Bridging communication between stakeholders and the team
Business stakeholders are often less technical in nature as developers. 
They will use a different language and the Tech Lead will need to mitigate that.

## Do we need a Technical Lead?
Some people argue against the role; claiming a team of well-functioning developers can make _decisions_ and _prioritise_ what is important to work on. 
Even when these perfect conditions would exist, during which team members talk to each openly, discussing pros and cons before arriving at an agreed solution, it doesn’t take much to upset this delicate balance. 

The Tech Lead role is just that – a role. 
Instead of focusing on whether or not the role should or should not exist, it is better to focus on ensuring all Tech Lead responsibilities are met. 
As with every leadership position, a bad leader can make things worse. 
With these tips I would like to aid you to make sure that doesn’t happen.

# Two sides to a story

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

As the job title implies, Technical  Lead  is a job with mixed responsibilities: there is a technical and a leadership side to the story.
It is very unlikely these sides will be equally divided. 
More on this in Tip 4.

# 1. Advocate for Change

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="image fit shadowed" alt="Change" src="/img/tech-lead/change.png">
</p>

Advocate for change, means installing a mind set of positive evolution.
When a proces is slow or cumbersome ... try to turn that around and make it better.
One way of doing this, is by using OODA loops: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act.
More information on OODA, can be found in this [earlier blogpost](https://ordina-jworks.github.io/architecture/2017/06/21/pragmatic-architecture-today.html).

In order to observe slow or cumbersome processes correctly, it is important to be part of the team and the experience the same pain as everybody else on the team.
You should adopt a state of mind that continuously wants to improve a certain situation. 
The Japanese call this [“Kaizen”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen). 
In this case the situation you want to improve is the efficiency and happiness of the team and the delivery of a software project.

Seek out the issues that prevent good teamwork.

# 2. Work through Failure and Success

## Things will fail

Things will fail. 
Don’t worry _too much_ about failure.
Builds will fail. 
Deploys will fail. 
Schedules will be missed. 
Crashes will happen. 
If you prepare for failure, it will be easier to cope with it.

When things fail, don’t look for someone to blame. 
You are the tech lead. 
Take responsibility and use your energy to fix the problem at hand and learn from it. 
Of course, **don’t fix the same bug twice**. 
If you need to fix the same bug twice, then you made a wrong decision.

Learning from failure, will shape your orientation and make for better decision-making in the future.

## Celebrate success

When the team has a sense of achievement, they will be happy and motivated, to be the best they can. 
It’s important to celebrate smaller achievements, like a successful sprint or a completed feature. 
I did a project once, where we delivered a system and the customer was really happy with it ... Unfortunately, the vision of the customer changed, and the project never made it to production. 
If that’s the moment you’ve been waiting for ... 

When someone comes up with a new idea, maybe an approach or framework they saw at a conference, _and_ if the idea delivers, it is important that whoever came with it, should be credited. 
This is very rewarding and will lead to more cooperation, creativity and out of the box thinking.

A drink on Friday evening, a small lunch, maybe a team building are all good ideas to get a happy and motivated team. 

Oh, and it’s fun.

# 3. Stay Technical

A Tech lead has a lot of non-coding responsibilities, but it is very important not to neglect the hands-on technical activities. 
* Write code, do proof-of-concepts, define interfaces, ... 
Depending on the maturity of the team your involvement will be different.
* Do code reviews and have your code reviewed. 
When new people arrive at the project, I tend to do most of their code reviews and I will be pretty strict. 
I will also elaborate on the reasoning for my remarks.
The number of changes they have to do will quickly become less.
* Insure a technical vision exists and is shared by the team. 
This vision needs to be in line with the customers needs. 
Customer needs will lead to important constraints, eg. regarding reuse (a throwaway project for marketing vs. a multiyear enterprise endeavour).
Sharing how you got to this vision with your team, will have a huge impact its adoption. 
Try to involve the team to arrive at the technical vision. 
And make sure they know how they contribute to reaching that vision.
* Keep an eye on the evolution of the code: after a while, the amount of actual coding you do _might_ be lower, but you need to stay up to date on the evolution of the code. 
You need te maintain awareness of the system and its technical constraints.

In general, most (if not all) developers will be happy to define frameworks, to use methodologies, etc. 
But some non-functional requirements (also called quality attributes) such as networking, security, deployment and consistency are often overlooked. 

# 4. Always Available

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="image fit shadowed" alt="Time Management" src="/img/tech-lead/time_management.png">
</p>

As a Tech Lead, you should always be available for your team; for questions, for support, for guidance or to make decisions. 
We started our journey by saying the technical leadership role has two important aspects and combining these is never easy. 
Something that makes a lot of sense (for me) is writing down the amount of effort you expect to put into certain tasks, eg.

* **Technical design:** preparing work for the team (that includes you). 
Making sure it is clear what needs to be implemented and how. 
This will often take a lot of quality attributes like networking, security, ... into consideration.
* **Business:** talking to the customer, looking at their needs and goals and matching these with the technical vision of the project.
* **Project Management:** defining user stories, estimating, follow-up.
* **Code:** writing code, doing code reviews, etc.

Now the assigned percentages will vary for everyone and for every project. 
It’s also important to look at the actuals. 
Because these will help you understand on what you are spending time. 


# 5. Be a mentor for your team

# 10. Estimating is hard

Estimating is hard. 
When you do it more often, you will get better at it ... but you still will get it wrong from time to time.

In Scrum or agile based projects, the entire team can participate in a [planning poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker) meeting. 
Planning poker can expose unknowns when estimating a user story.
In general, there are two approaches to cope with these unknowns: doing a technical design before starting with the user story (eg. by defining a spike) or accepting the risks, together with your business stakeholders.

As a technical lead, you will likely need to do estimations before the team is actually building something or when responding to RFPs (request for proposals). 
This can be to give business stakeholders an idea of the potential cost, to decide on priorities or to evaluate staff.

To achieve this, I suggest using three point estimates, where you do an optimistic, a best guess and a pessimistic estimate and use this formula: **(O + 4BG + P) ÷ 6**  to get the weighted mean.
Depending on the nature of the estimation, the number of unknown unknowns might be large: the project can be very similar to other projects or completely different. 
Factor these in. 
Estimate for the team that will do the implementation: you are probably estimating a real project. 
That is not the fastest time _you_ can possibly do something, in the best possible conditions. 
The estimations represent the **ability to execute** for a team; not your ability to do the implementation yourself. 
Also make sure, you know your deliverables. 
This can be more then the code, eg. code quality assurance reports, manuals, ...

Document assumptions.

Mastering estimation is a lifelong journey. 
It will set you apart. 
And your colleagues will associate you with professionalism, stability, and quality work.

# Conclusion
Your team’s strength is not a function of the talent of individual members. 
It’s a function of their collaboration, tenacity, and mutual respect.
