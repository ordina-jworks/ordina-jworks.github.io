# What is Technical Leadership
A Technical Lead has the responsibility to help the team move forwards. 
In general, the person assigned to the role, is someone who has sound technical experience and strong communication skills. 
He or she will be accountable for the technical direction of the project / product and serve as the go-to person for cross-team interactions.

When it comes to medium to large teams it is quite common to have a full-time tech lead present, responsible for important leadership activities such as

* Guiding the project technical vision. 
Eg. what technology are we going to use, how are we going to deliver the project, what patterns will we use, etc.
* Analyzing risks and cross-functional requirements.
** Analysing risk obviously means mitigating risk: can we chose a certain approach or does it have too many unknowns.
** What will the impact on the project be of taking a certain risk. 
Eg. introducing a new technology you saw at a conference.
* Coaching less experienced people.
You most likely will have mixed experience in your team. 
This makes a lot of sense when it comes to cost of a project, mixing and matching skills and experience; thus educating less experienced people.
* Bridging communication between stakeholders and the team
Business stakeholders are often less technical in nature as developers. 
They will use a different language and the tech lead will need to mitigate that.
