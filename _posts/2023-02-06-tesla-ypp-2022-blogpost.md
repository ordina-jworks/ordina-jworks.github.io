# Introduction

During Ordina's Young Professionals Program of 2022, we worked on this spectacular dev case.
As a software developer, you must integrate different technologies to build a functional and efficient system.
This dev case required us to use various tools and technologies, from Spring Boot to AWS and Helm.
This blog post will share our experience working with these technologies (Spring Boot, Terraform, Google Assistant, GitHub Actions, etc.) to build a scalable and reliable system that meets the project's requirements.
In addition, we will discuss the main problems we encountered during the dev case and how we overcame them.

## Our objective

Our mission? Develop two distinct applications harnessing the prowess of Tesla Cars.

**Application One: Tesla Rock-Paper-Scissors Duel**

Imagine two Teslas engaging in a classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. 
This was what our first application sought to achieve. 
Here's how the game was mapped:

- Rock = Lower Windows
- Paper = Flash Lights
- Scissors = Honk Horn

Two dedicated users, each connected to their own Tesla, would choose an action equivalent to a Tesla command. 
Beyond the sheer fun of it, we envisioned this application as a hit at conferences, designed to turn heads and pique curiosity.

**Application Two: Voice-Controlled Tesla**

Our second application was an integration with Google Home.
The aim? To control a Tesla using simple voice commands. 
Whether it was initiating or halting charging, or inquiring about the battery's status, we felt the thrill of integrating with a third-party tool. 
This app was not just about functionality but also about the joy of innovation.

# Functionalities

## Rock-Paper-Scissors

### Step 1: Token Acquisition.

The stage is set. 
Players pick their moves, which the system then translates into respective Tesla commands.

### Step 3: Action Time.

The chosen commands spring into action on the Teslas.

# Google Integration

## Step 1: Link Tesla to Google Home

## Journey and Challenges

This section is about the steps weâ€™ve taken to accomplish our results and some challenges we faced.

Before we started the project, we researched the mobile Tesla App and the corresponding API.
For this, we made use of unofficial [Tesla API Documentation](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

As direct requests to the authentic Tesla API are not always feasible, we opted to create a Stub API that emulates the functionality of the actual API but with dummy data.
This enabled us to locally test all components, systematically implement features, and receive better error messages.

We then developed a Proxy API that can be used by any of our applications that interact with Teslas.
The proxy is responsible for manipulating all incoming requests in a way acceptable to Tesla.
This includes the addition of tokens, object alterations, parameter additions, etc.

<img src="{{ '/img/2023-02-06-tesla-ypp-2022-blogpost/dummyproxy.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Client send request to dummy proxy api" class="image fit" style="max-width:100%; height:100%">|<img src="{{ '/img/2023-02-06-tesla-ypp-2022-blogpost/stubproxy-to-stubapi.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Client send request to stub proxy api, that forward request to stub tesla api" class="image fit" style=" max-width:100%; height:100%">

<img src="{{ '/img/2023-02-06-tesla-ypp-2022-blogpost/proxy-to-api.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Client send request to proxy api, that forward request to tesla api" class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto; max-width:60%; height:60%">

To simplify our development process, we worked with three separate profiles within the proxy: one that interacts directly with the authentic Tesla API, another with our own Stub API, and a final profile that returns dummy data without an external service.
This way, we could switch easily and validate our code quickly.

A Tesla vehicle will go into a sleeping state at random moments.
It could take several seconds before the vehicle is online and ready to receive commands.
To wake up the vehicle, we need to call an endpoint.
It could take a few seconds, so we created a retry mechanism with a timeout.

<img src="{{ '/img/2023-02-06-tesla-ypp-2022-blogpost/wake-up-mechanisme.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Client send request to proxy api, that forward request to tesla api. When received a 408 error, the proxy send a wake up request" class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto; max-width:70%; height:70%">

**Diagram Explanation**: When the vehicle is in sleeping mode, the Tesla API returns a 408 error while trying to execute a command.
Our proxy will catch this error, send a wake-up request, and try to execute the command again after 10 seconds.
This will be done a maximum of five times.

Another challenge we faced developing the Proxy API was authentication.
Because someone must trust us with his Tesla vehicle (and tokens), we aimed to use an identity management solution that we have complete control over, like AWS Cognito, to link users to a Tesla account and manage access.
This way, there are no Tesla tokens on the client side, and we can manage the tokens in a secret vault on the server side.

Tesla tokens expire every eight hours, so we need to refresh them automatically to keep using the vehicles in our applications.
We managed to do this on AWS using the Secrets Manager and Lambda services.

<img src="{{ '/img/2023-02-06-tesla-ypp-2022-blogpost/refresh-tokens.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Every 7 hours the lambda to refresh the acess token is triggered" class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto; max-width:70%; height:70%">

**Diagram Explanation**: The owner of the Tesla must log in with his credentials and send his tokens directly to our Proxy application, which will save them in AWS Secrets Manager.
A lambda will be executed every seven hours to refresh the Access Token.

Now that our "foundation" was ready, we started creating our rock-paper-scissors application, where we wanted to implement the business logic to play it between two Teslas.

Finally, we added the Google Home integration consulting its [documentation](https://developers.home.google.com/cloud-to-cloud/guides){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
We wanted to use Tesla Authentication directly so that Google could manage the tokens.
The only problem was that we couldn't directly set the redirect URL from the Tesla client to our Google Application.

We developed a Custom Auth API that involved a simple process to resolve this issue.
First, users must log in through our Auth API to add a device to the Google Home App, which redirects them to the Tesla login page.
After logging in, they needed to copy the authorization code and send it to our application.
Our Auth API handled the rest, and the user logged in successfully.

To summarize, we researched the Tesla App and API, created a Stub API, developed a Proxy API, implemented the rock-paper-scissors game, and integrated Google Home.
Despite challenges, we completed the project.

## ARCHITECTURE

This section is about the architecture that is used.
We are starting with more information about the global architecture.
Later, there will be zoomed in on the architecture used for the two different applications that are built: Rock-Paper-Scissors and Google Integration.

<img src="{{ '/img/2023-02-06-tesla-ypp-2022-blogpost/tesla-architecture.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="It shows every resource used to create the whole tesla application" class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto; max-width:70%; height:70%">

Above, you can see a complete diagram of the architecture we've used to accomplish our results.
Everything within the black-lined square represents services running on AWS.
The purple square represents our applications running on Kubernetes in the AWS EKS-Cluster.

We've used GitHub and GitHub actions combined with Terraform, Helm, and Docker for deploying and CI/CD.

In the context of testing, we've used Postman to test REST and Gatling for performance testing.

## ROCK PAPER SCISSORS ARCHITECTURE

<img src="{{ '/img/2023-02-06-tesla-ypp-2022-blogpost/rock-paper-scissors-architecture.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="It shows every resource used to create the whole rock paper scissors application" class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto; max-width:70%; height:70%">

A user will first need to authenticate themselves using Cognito before sending requests.

An API Gateway was not necessary but was added for educational purposes.
As a result, we needed to link it to our RPS(Rock-Paper-Scissors)-application via a VPC link to our Network Load Balancer (NLB) next to an Application Load Balancer (ALB) that will be connected to our RPS application.

The RPS application then communicates with our Proxy-API that will (based on the active profile) communicate with one of the Tesla-APIs.

Finally, the key rotation mentioned in the previous section is also included in the diagram.

## GOOGLE HOME ARCHITECTURE

<img src="{{ '/img/2023-02-06-tesla-ypp-2022-blogpost/google-architecture.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="It shows every resource used to create the whole google application" class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto; max-width:70%; height:70%">

The applications are deployed on Kubernetes and made accessible through Ingress and Route53.
The Google Nest Speaker, integrated with Google Assistant, is linked to a Google Home account, which, in turn, is connected to our applications.
The Proxy API is communicating with the Tesla APIs

## Used Technologies

The development of our project required the use of a variety of technologies to ensure a successful outcome.
Here's a brief overview of each technology and why it was chosen.

1. AWS: AWS was chosen as the cloud platform for our project because of its scalability, efficiency, and security benefits.
By leveraging the resources offered by AWS, we were able to take advantage of the many benefits of cloud computing.

2. Terraform: Terraform is a tool used for infrastructure as code.
This tool allowed us to automate the provisioning and management of our infrastructure on AWS, making it easier for us to manage and maintain our infrastructure over time.
The whole infrastructure will be deployed on Monday morning and destroyed on Friday night using a cronjob.

3. GitHub + GitHub Actions: GitHub is a version control platform that we use to store and manage our code.
GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) platform that allows us to automate the build, test, and deployment of our application.
The CI/CD will run every time a pull request is created.
It validates that the application can be built using Maven.
When code changes are pushed directly to the "develop" branch, this action serves as the second trigger for the CI/CD pipeline. In addition to running build and test processes, this trigger also initiates a Terraform deployment to our development environment. This workflow ensures that not only is the code validated but also the underlying infrastructure in the Dev environment is modified or extended as required. 

4. Java Spring Boot: Java Spring Boot is a framework used for building microservices and web applications.
In our project, we utilized the power of Java Spring Boot to build the back end of our application.
Our project consisted of several different microservices, including the RPS proxy, RPS backend, stub Tesla API, Google application, and Tesla authenticator.
Each of these microservices played a crucial role in the functionality and performance of our overall application.

5. Google Actions: Google Actions is a platform for building conversational experiences for Google Assistant.
We used Google Actions to build and integrate conversational interfaces into our application.
For authenticating our users, Google Actions is linked to our AWS Cognito.
Google actions send different request, like for instance a synchronization, to the webhook of our Google Application Microservice, which we have developed.

6. Docker: Docker is a containerization technology used for deploying and managing applications.
We used Docker to containerize our application, which allowed us to easily deploy and manage our application.

7. Kubernetes + Helm: Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform used for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
We used Kubernetes to manage our Docker containers and Helm to simplify the deployment and management of our application.

8. Renovate: Renovate is a tool used for automating the updating of dependencies in our application.
We used Renovate to ensure that our dependencies were always up-to-date and secure.
It automatically makes a pull request when a new version of a dependency is found.
Weâ€™ve set a limit at 2 pull requests made by Renovate, so that we can maintain a good overview.

9. Postman: Postman is a tool used for testing and documenting APIs.
We used Postman to test our APIs, which allowed us to ensure that our APIs were working correctly and that they were easy to use for other developers.

10. Gatling: Gatling is a load-testing tool used to test the performance of our application.
We used Gatling to ensure that our application could handle high volumes of traffic and remain performant under heavy load.

## Final Product

Our final product consists of two applications designed to offer a unique and engaging user experience.
The first application is a fun and interactive game allowing users to play the classic rock paper scissors with their Tesla car.

The second application is a Google Home app that enables users to control a Tesla car using Google Assistant.
With this application, users
can quickly check their vehicle's temperature and battery level and start and stop charging with just a few simple voice commands.
Users can connect Google Assistant to their Tesla car quickly and easily, offering a fun solution to manage their vehicle.

## Developer Experience

Developing an application can be complex, especially when dealing with unfamiliar technologies.
Our project encountered several challenges, but our most significant achievement was learning and growing our skills.

Communication was one of the significant challenges we faced during the project.
It could have been more evident who was responsible for which task.
This resulted in duplicated functions and conflicting efforts.
To address this issue, we had to improve our communication and agile working and ensure that all team members were aware of each other's progress.

Deploying a complex application in the cloud can also present several challenges, especially when dealing with unfamiliar platforms like AWS.
To set up all the necessary resources in AWS, we had to learn how to work with Terraform, which required attending workshops, consulting documentation, and utilizing tutorials to learn this essential skill.

Furthermore, deploying the application using Kubernetes proved incredibly challenging, as we needed to gain experience with this technology.
This required us to explore various solutions, test different approaches, and collaborate closely with our team members to overcome this challenge.

In the end, the challenges we faced proved to be valuable lessons.
We completed our project by improving our communication and acquiring new skills.
Our experience has taught us the importance of collaboration and adaptability when working with unfamiliar technologies.
These lessons will prove beneficial in future projects and enable us to tackle even more complex challenges in application development.
