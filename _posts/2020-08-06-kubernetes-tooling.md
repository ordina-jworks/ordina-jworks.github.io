## 1. Company logo placement and usage
First things first. Your user always needs to find their way back to the homepage in a heartbeat. 
Providing a 'Home' link in your menu is not enough. 
It's surprising how often users click on the company logo on the top of your page so make sure it's visible from every page and provide a link behind it to the homepage.
The company logo is typically placed in the top left corner (on sites designed for left-to-right reading).

<img alt="Logo of Goodreads is placed in the top left corner and is clickable" src="{{ '/img/2020-07-28-Best-Practices-In-UX-UI-Design/logo-placement.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto; max-width: 1000px;">

## 2. Make clickable elements obvious
### Buttons
CTA ([Call To Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_action_(marketing)){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}) buttons need to stand out from the rest of the page so it immediately draws the user's attention.
Adding a shadow effect to the buttons lets the user know it's clickable and they can interact with it.
Notice the difference between the following examples:

Example 1:
<img alt="Clear CTA button" src="{{ '/img/2020-07-28-Best-Practices-In-UX-UI-Design/CTA-colored.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="image fit" style="margin:0px auto; max-width: 300px;">
