## Introduction

We started this kickstarter trajectory with 4 kickstarters. Jago was freshly graduated from school, where Giel and Yolan already had working expierence in IT. Seppe had multiple years working expierence in Digital signage, but made a career change and was also new to the IT.
The main goals of the kickstarter course was to give every kickstarter knowlegde of the best practiced within JWORKS and to intruduce them to the IT world.

the shedule: 
* One month of training: both back-end, front-end, Devops, tools, Clous, Agile. 
* The second month we got a DevCase were we put everything we learned into practice.

## First day

#### Morning

On the first day there we were welcomed by Robbe Struys and Angello Gallo. They gave us the basic information about the HR working of ordina. After recieving the keys to our new car and our laptop they showed us how to work with Ordina Connect. We made our first CV and filled in our first timesheet entry. They toured us arround the office and introduced us to the future colleuges. They were very friendly and all said that we made the right choise, this was very nice to hear and put us a ease. We had brunch together and the we had a group picture aswel as our profile pictures.

#### Afternoon

With our new laptop's in hand we needed an introduction to what development enviremont we needed to use, Kevind van den Abele showed us the ropes.

## Git

A tool al developers use is version control, the preferred tool at ordina is Git. We learned to use git, the best pratices to use and al this used in the terminal of course. In the next course we needed to use git to get examples and test our skills. 

## Databases



## Clean Code

[Pieter Van Hees](/author/pieter-van-hees) gave us a course of clean code. He taught us the best practices on how to write clean code based. This mainly focussed on the readaility of the code so other developpers can easely addopt your code and know how its set up. 

## Frontend 
>during our first week we had multiple course about front-end. First we saw 

## Spring course
> [Ken Coenen](./author/ken-counen) gave us a Spring and Spring Boot. The course was given in three days, on the first day we saw the basics of spring, then he transistioned to Srping boot and more indepth configuration. Ken made an application from scratch and explained al the steps taken, always showing us the best praticed ways of implementation.

### Day 3

After we knew the basics, together with ken we made an simple application were we used the standard configuration but adjusted the configuration were needed to our needs.

## Unit Testing and mocking in Java

We got an introduction to testing and mocking by [Maarten Casteel](/author/maarten-casteels). 
It was a very interactie theory session were we learned how important testing really is, its goals, and how to setup a testing enviroment. 

After the lunch break we were given some excercies to make. Here Maarten went over them and showed us the pitfals and best practices. 

We learned a lot in this course because it was al new for us.
