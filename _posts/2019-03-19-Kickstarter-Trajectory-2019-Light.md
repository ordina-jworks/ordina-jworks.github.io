## Introduction

We started this kickstarter trajectory with four kickstarters. Jago was freshly graduated from school, where Giel and Yolan already had working expierence in IT. Seppe had multiple years working expierence in Digital signage, but made a career change and was also new to IT.
The main goals of the kickstarter course was to give every kickstarter a knowlegdebase of the best practices within JWORKS and to introduce them to the IT world.

## First day
#### Morning

On the first day there we were welcomed by Robbe Struys and Angella Gallo. They gave us the basic information about the HR working of Ordina. After recieving the keys to our new car and our laptop they showed us how to work with Ordina Connect. We made our first CV and filled in our first timesheet entry. They toured us arround the office and introduced us to the future colleuges. They were very friendly and all said that we made the right choise, this was very nice to hear and put us a ease. We had brunch together and the we had a group picture aswel as our profile pictures.

#### Afternoon

With our new laptop's in hand we needed an introduction to what development enviremont we needed to use, Kevind van den Abele showed us the ropes.

## Git

A tool al developers use is version control, the preferred tool at ordina is Git. We learned to use git, the best pratices to use and al this used in the terminal of course. If you woud like a program you can use Gitkraken. All allong the kickstarter traject we woud use git to get our code examples and presentations.

We went over good practices and learned by doing this hands-on on our own machines. Creating our own repository’s and when needed branching and merging them. [Yannick](/author/yannick-de-turck/) our teacher for this course was very clear to avoid spaghetti history by rebasing and squashing your commits to give a clean linear overview that is readable by your co-workers.

## Docker

As the era of containerization is rising, it only feels right to teach us the fundamentals about it and the importance of Docker in a project. That's why they asked [Tom Verelst](./author/tom-verelst) to give us a detailed presentation about the mystical power of Docker. After the first introduction, we were soon 'dockerizing' our first full-stack application. We also combined everything together with Docker Compose, which made us start our whole full-stack application with just one command!

The session gave us an overview as to how Docker is used in the real world, and we couldn't wait to use an orchestration framework to deploy our containers into the cloud!

## Clean Code

[Pieter Van Hees](/author/pieter-van-hees) gave us a course of clean code, this course was not foccussed an creating new code but improving the way you write the code. 
#### Improvements:
- Readability
- Maintainability
- Avoid rewrites
  
The biggest enemy of clean code is pressure so Pieter advised us to take our time to write clean code. This course only gave an introduction and he recommended us to read the book by Robert Cecil Martin.

## Databases

## Frontend 
during our first week we had multiple course about front-end. First we saw 

## Java Language Features
Java is a pretty popular language in the bacekend development world, and is our preferred backend language here at JWorks. That's why [Yannick De Turck](./author/yannick-de-turck) explained us the newest features of Java versions 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Java 11 is the newest LTS version, so it was important for us to get a detailed explanation about its newest changes and features. 

One of the most useful features that Java 10 introduced is the 'var' keyword. How great is it that you don't have to specify the type twice during the initialization of an object!?

Other than that, there were alot of extra useful features that will certainly be nice to have once we need to use it. It was very entertaining to get a quick overview as to what is new, what is being removed or deprecated and what we can or should expect in the coming Java versions.

## Spring Framework
<img class="image left" alt="Spring logo" src="/img/2019-Kickstarter-Trajectory-2019-light/spring-logo.png">

For a framework this big and popular, we followed a three-day course given by [Ken Coenen](./author/ken-coenen). On the first day, we received a brief explanation as to how the Spring magic works behind the scenes (dependency injection, beans, ...). We saw the basic of the most common components of the full Spring Framework such as Cloud, Security, ... . 

On the second day, we dived into the magic behind Spring Boot. It's remarkable how much Spring Boot does for you without any configuration needed, although you can fully configure Spring Boot to your needs and satisfactions.


On the third day, [Ken](./author/ken-coenen) did a live coding session and created a Spring Boot application from scratch and explained how to fully initialize your Spring Boot project and get the most out of it through various steps and always showing the best practices for each implementation.

#### Full House during the third day

Ofcourse, afterwards we had some time to relax after three days of exploring the Spring Framework. We closed our three-day session on Friday with the best combination: pizza and beer!

#### Pizza & beer!

## Unit Testing and mocking in Java

We got an introduction to Unit Testing in java from [Maarten Casteel](/author/maarten-casteels). 

#### The red line:

- Goals of Testing
- What to Test
- Fixtures
- Mocks
- Assertions

In the morning we got a very interactive theory session were we learned how important testing really is, the basics and what it all stands for. In the afternoon we learned to unit test our code, the best ways to do this, how to mock dependencies, use fixtures and a whole lot more. Maarten also showed us the most commen pitfalls to avoid, and some best practices like test-driven development(TDD) and how building test can help you with refactoring your code and lastly look at it with a different vision.

For lunch we went to a place called Mo’s were we were introduced to a whole other world of sandwiches. Once you’ve been there you will know what we mean by that, don’t go to often tough.

## Kubernetes
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open source container orchestration framework which was first introduced to us by [Tom Verelst](./author/tom-verelst) during the kickstarter traject. It is made by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. First they introduced us to all the features that Kubernetes possesses (service discovery, horizontal scaling, load balancing, ...). 

Soon we learned how to deploy Docker containers in the cloud by using Kubernetes, and afterwards we had an hands-on exercise where we could deploy a full-stack application to a Kubernetes cluster using [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube). It's wonderful how you can deploy a full-stack application through Kubernetes with just one configuration file needed. Ofcourse, it takes some time to get used to it, but once you get the hang of it, you can do outstanding stuff with this platform!
