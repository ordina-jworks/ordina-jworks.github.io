## Introduction

We started this kickstarter trajectory with 4 kickstarters. Jago was freshly graduated from school, where Giel and Yolan already had working expierence in IT. Seppe had multiple years working expierence in Digital signage, but made a career change and was also new to the IT.
The main goals of the kickstarter course was to give every kickstarter knowlegde of the best practiced within JWORKS and to intruduce them to the IT world.

the shedule: 
* One month of training: both back-end, front-end, Devops, tools, Clous, Agile. 
* The second month we got a DevCase were we put everything we learned into practice.

## First day

#### Morning

On the first day there we were welcomed by Robbe Struys and Angello Gallo. They gave us the basic information about the HR working of ordina. After recieving the keys to our new car and our laptop they showed us how to work with Ordina Connect. We made our first CV and filled in our first timesheet entry. They toured us arround the office and introduced us to the future colleuges. They were very friendly and all said that we made the right choise, this was very nice to hear and put us a ease. We had brunch together and the we had a group picture aswel as our profile pictures.

#### Afternoon

With our new laptop's in hand we needed an introduction to what development enviremont we needed to use, Kevind van den Abele showed us the ropes.

## Git

A tool al developers use is version control, the preferred tool at ordina is Git. We learned to use git, the best pratices to use and al this used in the terminal of course. In the next course we needed to use git to get examples and test our skills. 

## Databases



## Clean Code

[Pieter Van Hees](/author/pieter-van-hees) gave us a course of clean code. He taught us the best practices on how to write clean code based. This mainly focussed on the readaility of the code so other developpers can easely addopt your code and know how its set up. 

## Frontend 
>during our first week we had multiple course about front-end. First we saw 

## Spring course
> [Ken Coenen](./author/ken-counen) gave us a Spring and Spring Boot. The course was given in three days, on the first day we saw the basics of spring, then he transistioned to Srping boot and more indepth configuration. Ken made an application from scratch and explained al the steps taken, always showing us the best praticed ways of implementation.

### Day 1

On the first day we learned the basic's of spring, the origin and how its build up

#### Full house

### Day 2 

On the second day we went into spring-boot, how it makes spring easyer and how it makes the default configuration. We mainly focust on how the dependencies works in spring-boot. 

### Day 3

After we knew the basics, together with ken we made an simple application were we used the standard configuration but adjusted the configuration were needed to our needs.

#### Pizza time 

Of course there was time for relaxing after the sessions. After our session on friday we ordered some pizza.

## Unit Testing and mocking in Java

We got an introduction to testing and mocking by [Maarten Casteel](/author/maarten-casteels). 
It was a very interactie theory session were we learned how important testing really is, its goals, and how to setup a testing enviroment. 

After the lunch break we were given some excercies to make. Here Maarten went over them and showed us the pitfals and best practices. 

We learned a lot in this course because it was al new for us. 

## TypeScript
After the session HTLML5, CSS, JavaScript. [Dimitri De Kerf](/author/dimitri-de-kerf) learned us the benefits of TypeScript. 
He told us some benefits of using TypeScript instead of JavaScript. This means that TypeScript is a wrapper around JavaScrip, 
which means it has more methods to use to develop a application which you otherwise would not be possible.

Like declaring declaring a colon and a type after the variable.

[Dimitri De Kerf](/author/dimitri-de-kerf) showed how to configure our project to use TypeScript and to use these features.
He explained us that it is important to know how to use TypeScript because it is used in popular frameworks Like Angular and React.


## Angular
[Ryan De Gruyter](/autor/Ryan-De-Gruyter) was our teacher for today, He quickly introduced us to Angular a platform that is designed to easily create browser applications build by Google. 
The first version of Angular was AngularJS, it was very popular and used in by many companies. Google decided to update Angular and created Angular 2 which was not welcomed by the industry at that time
because it removed all the AngularJS concepts. 

It took some time for the industry to adapt and see the positive stuff of Angular2: Open Source Community, Improved Dependency injection, better performance, enc..
Angular2 is not the holy grail of frameworks it still has some downsides like lot's of ceremony and boilerplate thanks to the use of Angular CLI.

After the information session he showed us how easy it was to create an Angular project, were we learned how to create an Angular application using small reusable pieces called components.

## Frontend hands-ondf

Today [Jan De Wilde](/autor/Jan-De-Wilde) asked if we still had question about the last Angular session. 
Because in this session we would create a Angular application using all the techniques we learned form the previous course and he wanted to be sure we understood everything before we started
So he went a bit deeper on some topics and showed us on how to write an API and to structure the project properly.

After the lunchbreach (we went ot the MUZ) when we were still digesting our food, we started to write a complete Angular application. 
[Jan De Wilde](/autor/Jan-De-Wilde) guided us through the process showing us possible issues we could encounter and explained how we could solve those issues.
 
 
## Intro to Cloud-Friendly Development
The first things we learn is the goal of a cloud friendly platform:
* Minimise time and cost for new developers joining the project.
* Offer maximum portability between execution environments.
* Enable continuous deployment for maximum agility.
* Obviate the need for servers and systems administration.
* Can scale up without significant changes in tooling, arch or development.

[Kevin Van Houtte](/autor/Kevin-Van-Houtte) introduced us to contract testing. It is a tool to write a exact input en output of a API call, after we run our project our contract will generate tests for our controller checking if the controller output is the same as we expected in the contract.
We can create 

## agile
We started flow to agile. First we saw different approaches to work as a team. Like the waterfall system that has some downsides, which doesn't give allot of feedback. The feedback is only in the end of life cycle of the project or when the project got tested. It also has more handouts which is when a team passes the product to another team.
When something needed to be changed because the testers found a bug the process started again form the top or a client was not happy with the product and wanted to change some stuff.

Another way of working was with Agile this has more benefits:
* Quicker risk reduciton
* limit handovers
* shortterm plans
  * to improve preditable, accuracy & reliability.
  *to redouce stress and unleash innovative emergent ideas
* Fit for complex challenges
* Tackling emergent changes
* Building on emergent insight

Next she wanted to show us what difference between a push and pull system was. By giving a live example, 4 people were choosen to work in a factory which everybody had is own task.
When we started the process using the push system we noticed that one of the person was the bottleneck of the system. Everything piled up next to him and the process slowed down. 
Next we could see the flow was faster because the people had less stress and could work continuously. Because of this the product flow was faster which would make the client more happy at the end.
