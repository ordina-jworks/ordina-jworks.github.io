> As a developer I want to know the IT landscape so that I can orientate and implement business value on various fields.” We do this by learning from experts and eagerly absorbing knowledge. Ordina happens to provide the perfect way of doing this by enrolling new employees in their “Kickstarter program”. During this three-week iteration we increased our value by familiarizing ourselves with the Ordina stack.

# What we have done

## Git <!-- Sam -->
During the first days of our kickstart traject we've got a brief explanation about git by [Yannick De Turk](/author/yannick-de-turck/).\
He explained us that git is an open-source, distributed version control system that keeps track of your files and history.
Basicly this means git offers us tooling to collaborate on code bases without overwriting each others changes so easily.
 
We saw which workflow JWorks uses in git and which commands we can use to do so.
This way we learned how to create git repo's, create separate branches for features or different environments for example.
And we even saw the different ways to merge branches for example.
One thing we'll definitely won't soon forget is to rebase when pulling to keep a clean non-spaghetti like history,
something that is preferred by many co-workers at JWorks! 
At least that is what Yannick has told us ;)
## Backend

### Spring and Spring boot <!-- Johan -->

### Microservices <!-- Yen -->

### Unit testing and mocking <!-- Dries -->

## Frontend


### Essentials <!-- Sam --> 
At the end of our first week we've learned some of the frontend essentials
before diving deeper into the frontend frameworks and build tools the next week.
This workshop was given by [Yannick Vergeylen](/author/yannick-vergeylen/)
and our colleagues from the Vision Works department accompanied us since they use the topics covered in this workshop as well.

After a theoretical introduction about HTML,CSS and Javascript we learned how to use HTML to create web pages 
and how CSS is used to style these pages and its components. 
We also used some javascript and learned how this is used to modify some of the HTML-components.

During the workshop we were given an exercise in which we had to recreate a given example page with the above technologies.
This way we had some hands-on experience straight away!
### Build Tools <!-- Yunus --> 

### Angular <!-- Sam --> 

## DevOps

### CI/CD <!-- Yunus -->

## Security <!-- Johan --> 

## Docker <!-- Nick --> 
We started with a recap of the theory behind creating images and spinning up containers.
Soon we were setting up our own images and learned how to run our applications in a container. 
On the way we experienced hands-on the advantages of docker like faster configuration and how it fits nicely in the process
of CI/CD.


# Recap <!--Everyone -->

Nu we klaar zijn met al deze onderwerpen, ieder van ons heeft er uit geleerd:

Per persoon (richtlijn 3 à 4 lijnen):

Nick: *“It has been almost a month since I joined Ordina. 
      They have given me the chance to further increase my knowledge by involving me in this kickstarters program. 
      It was great to learn about their top-notch stack from their own experts. Thi is exactly what I was looking for. 
      The kickstarter program just endend and I'm eager to start using my knowledge in an enterprise environment again“*
