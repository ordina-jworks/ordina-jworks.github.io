## Introduction
54 young professionals started the Ordina Kickstarter trajectory, on the 1st of August, this summer. 
JWorks counted 5 kickstarters: Sander, Steven, Ken, Wout en Michael. All looking for a challenge and a fresh start. 
Some just graduated from school, others already had multiple years of experience, IT related or not. 
The goal was to broaden every kickstarterâ€™s knowledge of the fast evolving IT world. 
We got taught the basics of every hot topic which will definitely give us enough credits for our first project.

## The Kickstarter Trajectory
The kickstarter trajectory consisted of 2 parts: 
* a month filled with all kinds of trainings: technical, non-technical, backend, frontend, devops...  
* After our minds were filled with all this information, there was a devcase where we could put everything we learned into practice.

### First Day
On the first day of the kickstarter trajectory we were welcomed into the company and got some introduction about the structure of the company. 
After that we got a tour around the building. Everyone we met was very friendly and helpful. This made us feel directly at ease. 
On the first day we also got the keys to our car and a laptop so we were equipped to begin our journey at Ordina.

### Security
In the beginning of the trajectory we got an introduction of the most important security principles also including information security like GDPR. 
This is very important to Ordina because all its consultants need to always have this information in the back of their heads when working at a customer.
We also followed a more technical security course which explained some of the most common attacks and how to avoid them.

### Devops
The trajectory also included some courses about the devops culture. We got some introductions to docker, kubernetes, openshift.

### Backend

### Frontend

### Soft Skills
Besides sharpening our technical skills we worked on our soft skills as well.
In the 2 day session 'Essentials Of Communication' we learned how to present ourselves by means of role playing games and cases that reflect real world scenarios.
After an additional 'Brand Yourself' session we were ready to prove and present ourselves as worthy consultants against the management of Ordina.
All these techniques are also useful in the Agile & Scrum methodologies where we learned the importance of being prepared for change.


### DevCase
In the second month of the kickstarter traject we were assigned to develop an event planner.
The purpose was to have more of an overview and control of the upcoming JWorks events.
In short, JWorks employees can create and approve events depending on their rights.
In addition, a weekly digest of the events is sent to the Telegram JWorks group and a bot is made available with some defined commands.
A more technical blogpost of the DevCase with an explanation of the used technologies and architecture will follow!
