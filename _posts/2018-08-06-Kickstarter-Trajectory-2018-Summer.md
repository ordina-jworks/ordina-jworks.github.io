## Introduction

## The Kickstarter Trajectory
The kickstarter trajectory consisted of 2 parts: 
* a month filled with all kinds of trainings: technical, non-technical, backend, frontend, devops...  
* After our minds were filled with all this information, there was a devcase where we could put everything we learned into practice.

### First Day
On the first day of the kickstarter trajectory we were welcomed into the company and got some introduction about the structure of the company. 
After that we got a tour around the building. Everyone we met was very friendly and helpful. This made us feel directly at ease. 
On the first day we also got the keys to our car and a laptop so we were equipped to begin our journey at Ordina.

### Security
In the beginning of the trajectory we got an introduction of the most important security principles also including information security like GDPR. 
This is very important to Ordina because all its consultants need to always have this information in the back of their heads when working at a customer.
We also followed a more technical security course which explained some of the most common attacks and how to avoid them.

### Devops
The trajectory also included some courses about the devops culture. We got some introductions to docker, kubernetes, openshift.

### Backend

### Frontend
