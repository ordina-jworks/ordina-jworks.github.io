## Introduction
54 young professionals started the Ordina Kickstarter trajectory, on the 1st of August, this summer. 
JWorks counted 5 kickstarters: Sander, Steven, Ken, Wout en Michael. All looking for a challenge and a fresh start. 
Some just graduated from school, others already had multiple years of experience, IT related or not. 
The goal was to broaden every kickstarterâ€™s knowledge of the fast evolving IT world. 
We got taught the basics of every hot topic which will definitely give us enough credits for our first project.

## The Kickstarter Trajectory
The kickstarter trajectory consisted of 2 parts: 
* a month filled with all kinds of trainings: technical, non-technical, backend, frontend, devops...  
* After our minds were filled with all this information, there was a devcase where we could put everything we learned into practice.

### First Day
On the first day of the kickstarter trajectory we were welcomed into the company and got some introduction about the structure of the company. 
After that we got a tour around the building. Everyone we met was very friendly and helpful. This made us feel directly at ease. 
On the first day we also got the keys to our car and a laptop so we were equipped to begin our journey at Ordina.

### Security
In the beginning of the trajectory we got an introduction of the most important security principles also including information security like GDPR. 
This is very important to Ordina because all its consultants need to always have this information in the back of their heads when working at a customer.
We also followed a more technical security course which explained some of the most common attacks and how to avoid them.

### Devops
The trajectory also included some courses about the devops culture. We got some introductions to docker, kubernetes, openshift.

### Backend

#### Java
In this lecture given by [Yannick De Turck](/author/yannick-de-turck/){:target="_blank"}, we got introduced to all new features of Java 7 and 8 aswell as Java 9.

We started off with Java 7 where we learned:
* Switch-statement with String values
* Automatic Resource Management
* Diamond Syntax
* Better exception handling with multi-catch
* Literal Enhancements
* The new IO API
* Fork Join Framework
* JVM Enhancements

Java 8 also introduced some useful new features:
* Lambda Expressions
* Extension Methods
* Functional Interfaces
* Method and Constructor References
* Streams and Bulk Data Operations for Collections
* Removal of PermGen
* New Date & Time API
* New Default API for Base64 Encoding
* Improvements for Annotations
* Performance Improvements

Last but not least we had an introduction of Java 9:
* Project Jigsaw: Modules
* Project Kulla: JShell
* Factory Methods for collections
* Diamond operator for anonymous inner classes
* Try-with-resources enhancement
* CompletableFuture API improvements
* Underscore ('_') character is a keyword
* Private methods in interfaces
* HTTP 2.0 Client
* Process API Improvements
* Reactive Streams
* Optional improvements
* Collectors Improvements
* Stream improvements

In the afternoon we made some excercises on these new features and improvements which gave us a brighter view on the possibilities within present development.

#### Spring and Spring Boot
The lectures of Spring and Spring Boot were given by [Ken Coenen](/author/ken-coenen){:target="_blank"}. These were spread over two days where the first day was an overal introduction to Spring fundamentals, followed by a second day where we have put everything into practice.

##### Day 1:
The first day we got an introduction to Spring and Spring Boot about the core fundamentals and concepts of JPA, Beans and Application contexts. After that we went further into the features of the framework where we got introduced to Spring Web Services and Spring Security.

##### Day 2:
On the second day we made a small project where we created a backend application to fetch all information of different digital coins (Cryptocurrencies). We learned how to read data from an API using DTO's and store them into a database. At the end of the day we had a fully working backend application which fetched all information automatically and exposed it to different endpoints.

### Frontend

### Soft Skills
Besides sharpening our technical skills we worked on our soft skills as well.
In the 2 day session 'Essentials Of Communication' we learned how to present ourselves by means of role playing games and cases that reflect real world scenarios.
After an additional 'Brand Yourself' session we were ready to prove and present ourselves as worthy consultants against the management of Ordina.
All these techniques are also useful in the Agile & Scrum methodologies where we learned the importance of being prepared for change.


### DevCase
In the second month of the kickstarter traject we were assigned to develop an event planner.
The purpose was to have more of an overview and control of the upcoming JWorks events.
In short, JWorks employees can create and approve events depending on their rights.
In addition, a weekly digest of the events is sent to the Telegram JWorks group and a bot is made available with some defined commands.
A more technical blogpost of the DevCase with an explanation of the used technologies and architecture will follow!
