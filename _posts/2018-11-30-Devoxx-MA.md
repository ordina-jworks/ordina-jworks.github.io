Charles-Philippe showed why he loves [VueJS](https://vuejs.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} so much.
He criticised Angular and React because of the companies behind the frameworks as well as the multiple variations of utilities and plugins. 
Instead, he prefers it when the community is as one block behind the framework. 
Which is why he really likes VueJS as is it community driven.
He explained that for each functionality there is exactly one solution promoted by the community.

During his session, Charles-Philippe went over several libraries that he uses: 

- CSS3
- [Velocity.js](http://velocityjs.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- [anime.js](http://animejs.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- [Vanilla-tilt.js](https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

A handy trick that we learned during the session is how to make a JPG transparent using CSS.
Note that this will only work if the image has a white background.

```(css)
img {
    mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```

## MockK, the idiomatic mocking framework for Kotlin by [Yannick De Turck](https://twitter.com/YannickDeTurck){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

Our colleague, Yannick, gave a talk about MockK.
MockK is a mocking framework specifically made for Kotlin. 
As a Java developer, Yannick is a huge fan of Mockito for using mocks in his unit tests.
When he picked up Kotlin, Mockito was also his first choice to try out.

He explained however that using Mockito in a Kotlin project doesn't seem to go all that well due to how Mockito creates its mocks, and classes and functions being final in Kotlin.
Yannick shared his experiences and even though there is an [incubating, opt-in feature](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/What%27s-new-in-Mockito-2#mock-the-unmockable-opt-in-mocking-of-final-classesmethods){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} to allow Mockito to mock classes and functions, the user experience wasn't that nice.

Yannick looked for other frameworks and stumbled upon [MockK](https://mockk.io){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, a mocking framework specifically created for Kotlin by [Oleksiy Pylypenko](https://github.com/oleksiyp){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
MockKâ€™s main philosophy is offering first-class support for Kotlin features and being able to write idiomatic Kotlin code when using it.
He was pretty enthusiastic about MockK and went over all its features and its ease of use. 

Yannick also wrote a [blog post](/testing/2018/02/05/Writing-tests-in-Kotlin-with-MockK.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} about his experiences with Mockito and MockK in Kotlin projects.

## Stream Processing Live Traffic Data with Kafka Streams by [Tom Van den Bulck](https://twitter.com/tomvdbulck){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Tim Ysewyn](https://twitter.com/TYsewyn){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

## Resiliency for 140 PB Cluster by [Meriam Lachkar](https://twitter.com/lachkar_m){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

Meriam works at [Criterio](https://www.criteo.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} which is a marketing company managing Europe's largest Hadoop cluster.

Criterio uses various technologies:
* Batch Processing: Map/Reduce and Apache Spark.
* Stream Processing: Apache Flink and Apache Kafka.
* Machine Learning: Spark ML and Tensorflow.

Her talk focused on the Hadoop setup of Criterio.
The current cluster in Paris has 220 PB of hard disk, 550 TB of memory and 100.000 cores.
But since it is almost "full", with 160 PB used, a new cluster has been set up in Amsterdam.
Between both clusters there is a dedicated 400 Gbit fiber installed.
Every day, 1 PB of data is generated.

Meriam currently works at a project in which they want to synchronise the data between both clusters.
This was not a trivial thing to do and the main question was how they were going to sync the data between both clusters, as copying over all data would fill the existing line for an entire day.
RSync was just too slow, also some jobs are non-deterministic which means that executing the job a second time will yield a different result than the first time.

Various options were considered:
* Double run: this means that the Paris data center would still become the bottleneck and would not yield real business value
* Producer push
* Consumer push
* Dedicated central service which will determine where the jobs will run, on which data center.

A dedicated central service was the chosen solution.
Codenamed "Mumak", as it is the convention to name everything in the Hadoop ecosystem to an elephant.

Dataset per dataset will be progressively moved to Amsterdam, so that jobs will eventually be distributed between both data centers.
