Thank you, Charles-Philippe, he showed why he loves VueJS so much, he complained about Angular and React because of the companies behind it. 
As well the multiple variations of utilities and the plugins. 
He likes it when the community is as one block behind the framework. 
So that why he likes VueJS is community driven, he was explaining that for each functionality there is one solution promoted by the community so that is lovely he said.

The frameworks he used in his presentation are: 

- CSS3
- Velocity.js
- Animate.css
- anime.js
- vanilla-tilt.js

What Iâ€™ve learned with CSS and I really liked is making a JPG transparent, I will only work when the image has a white background.

```(css)
img {
    mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```

## MockK, the idiomatic mocking framework for Kotlin [Yannick De Turck](https://twitter.com/YannickDeTurck){:target="_blank"}

Our colleague Yannick has spoken about MockK, a mocking framework for Kotlin. 
A lot of people use Kotlin on a daily basis and most of them uses Mockito, the known framework in Java. 
The difference between them was explained by Yannick and why to choose MockK.

## Resiliency for 140 PB Cluster by [Meriam Lachkar](https://twitter.com/lachkar_m) 

Meriam works at [Criterio](https://www.criteo.com/) which is a marketing company managing Europe's largest Hadoop cluster.

Criterio uses various technologies:
* Batch Processing: Map/Reduce and Apache Spark.
* Stream Processing: Apache Flink and Apache Kafka.
* Machine Learning: Spark ML and Tensorflow.

Her talk focussed on the Hadoop setup of Criterio.
The current cluster in Paris has 220 PB of hard disk, 550 TB of memory and 100 000 cores.
But since it is almost "full", with 160 PB used, a new cluster has been setup in Amsterdam.
Between both clusters there is a dedicated 400 Gbit fiber installed.
Everyday 1 PB of data is generated.

Meriam currently works on a project wich will sync the data between both clusters.


How to sync the data between both clusters, as copying over all data would fill the existing line for an entire day.

RSync was just too slow, also some jobs are non-deterministic => executing the job a second time will yield a different result then the first time.


Various options were considered:
* double run: this means that the Paris data center would still become the bottleneck and would not yield real business value
* producer push
* consumer push
* dedicated central service which will determine where the jobs will run, on which data center.

A dedicated central service was the chosen solution => codename Mumak, everything in the Hadoop ecosystem needs to be named to an elephant.

Dataset per dataset will be progressively moved to Amsterdam, so that jobs will eventually be distributed between both datacenters.
