Thank you, Charles-Philippe, he showed why he loves VueJS so much, he complained about Angular and React because of the companies behind it. 
As well the multiple variations of utilities and the plugins. 
He likes it when the community is as one block behind the framework. 
So that why he likes VueJS is community driven, he was explaining that for each functionality there is one solution promoted by the community so that is lovely he said.

The frameworks he used in his presentation are: 

- CSS3
- Velocity.js
- Animate.css
- anime.js
- vanilla-tilt.js

What Iâ€™ve learned with CSS and I really liked is making a JPG transparent, I will only work when the image has a white background.

```(css)
img {
    mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```

## MockK, the idiomatic mocking framework for Kotlin [Yannick De Turck](https://twitter.com/YannickDeTurck){:target="_blank"}

Our colleague Yannick has spoken about MockK, a mocking framework for Kotlin. 
A lot of people use Kotlin on a daily basis and most of them uses Mockito, the known framework in Java. 
The difference between them was explained by Yannick and why to choose MockK.
