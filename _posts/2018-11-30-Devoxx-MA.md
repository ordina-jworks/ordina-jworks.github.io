## The Speakers dinner
The evening before the conference started we had the speakers dinner, sponsored by [Lightbend](https://www.lightbend.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
The dinner was at restaurant [Kasar El Hamra](http://www.restaurant-ksarelhamra.net){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} in the center of Marrakesh.
On our way to the center we got to experience the Moroccan traffic which seemed to be pretty chaotic with all cars and motorcycles zipping around each other on the streets.
Once at the restaurant we got treated with one Moroccan dish after the other.
Each of them truly delicious.

## VueJS animation in action by [Charles-Philippe Bernard](https://twitter.com/charlyouki){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Charles-Philippe Bernard" src="/img/devoxx-ma-2018/speaker-charles-philippe.png"></span>

Charles-Philippe explained why he loves [VueJS](https://vuejs.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} so much.
He criticised Angular and React because of the companies behind the frameworks as well as the multiple variations of utilities and plugins. 
Instead, he prefers it when the community is as one block behind the framework. 
Which is why he really likes VueJS as is it community-driven.
He explained that for each functionality there is exactly one solution promoted by the community.

During his session, Charles-Philippe went over several libraries that he often uses for animated websites: 

- CSS3
- [Velocity.js](http://velocityjs.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- [anime.js](http://animejs.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- [Vanilla-tilt.js](https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

A handy trick that we learned during the session is how to make a JPG transparent using CSS.
Note that this will only work if the image has a white background.

```(css)
img {
    mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```

## MockK, the idiomatic mocking framework for Kotlin by [Yannick De Turck](https://twitter.com/YannickDeTurck){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Yannick De Turck" src="/img/devoxx-ma-2018/speaker-yannick-de-turck.png"></span>

Our colleague, Yannick, gave a talk about MockK.
MockK is a mocking framework specifically made for Kotlin. 
As a Java developer, Yannick is a huge fan of Mockito for using mocks in his unit tests.
When he picked up Kotlin, Mockito was also his first choice to try out.

He explained however that using Mockito in a Kotlin project doesn't seem to go all that well due to how Mockito creates its mocks, and classes and functions being final in Kotlin.
Yannick shared his experiences and even though there is an [incubating, opt-in feature](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/What%27s-new-in-Mockito-2#mock-the-unmockable-opt-in-mocking-of-final-classesmethods){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} to allow Mockito to mock classes and functions, the user experience wasn't that nice.

Yannick looked for other frameworks and stumbled upon [MockK](https://mockk.io){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, a mocking framework specifically created for Kotlin by [Oleksiy Pylypenko](https://github.com/oleksiyp){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
MockKâ€™s main philosophy is offering first-class support for Kotlin features and being able to write idiomatic Kotlin code when using it.
He was pretty enthusiastic about MockK and went over all its features and its ease of use. 

Yannick also wrote a [blog post](/testing/2018/02/05/Writing-tests-in-Kotlin-with-MockK.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} about his experiences with Mockito and MockK in Kotlin projects.

## Resiliency for 140 PB Cluster by [Meriam Lachkar](https://twitter.com/lachkar_m){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Meriam Lachkar" src="/img/devoxx-ma-2018/speaker-meriam-lachkar.png"></span>

Meriam works at [Criterio](https://www.criteo.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} which is a marketing company managing Europe's largest Hadoop cluster.

Criterio uses various technologies:
* Batch Processing: Map/Reduce and Apache Spark.
* Stream Processing: Apache Flink and Apache Kafka.
* Machine Learning: Spark ML and Tensorflow.

Her talk focused on the Hadoop setup of Criterio.
The current cluster in Paris has 220 PB of hard disk, 550 TB of memory and 100.000 cores.
But since it is almost "full", with 160 PB used, a new cluster has been set up in Amsterdam.
Between both clusters there is a dedicated 400 Gbit fiber installed.
Every day, 1 PB of data is generated.

Meriam currently works at a project in which they want to synchronise the data between both clusters.
This was not a trivial thing to do and the main question was how they were going to sync the data between both clusters, as copying over all data would fill the existing line for an entire day.
RSync was just too slow, also some jobs are non-deterministic which means that executing the job a second time will yield a different result than the first time.

Various options were considered:
* Double run: this means that the Paris data center would still become the bottleneck and would not yield real business value
* Producer push
* Consumer push
* Dedicated central service which will determine where the jobs will run, on which data center.

A dedicated central service was the chosen solution.
Codenamed "Mumak", as it is the convention to name everything in the Hadoop ecosystem to an elephant.

Dataset per dataset will be progressively moved to Amsterdam, so that jobs will eventually be distributed between both data centers.

## The Speakers Trip in Essaouira
Up next after three interesting days of the Devoxx MA conference was the speakers trip to Essaouira, considered as one of the best anchorages of the Moroccan coast.
We started off by visiting [Chez Ali](http://restaurant-chez-ali.com/en/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} in Marrakesh on the last evening of the conference.
As we arrived we were heartily greeted by horsemen and Moroccans playing authentic music.
We got to explore Ali Baba's cave before passing by all kinds of folkloric groups.
Dinner was served in big tents and consisted of multiples courses of Moroccan dishes.
After the dinner we got to watch an amazing spectacle of stuntmen on horses, belly dancers and cavaliers.

The morning after we set off to Essaouira with three buses filled of speakers and people part of the Devoxx MA organisation.
Along the three-hour long ride we stopped by the magnificent "goat tree" and Arganomade, a place where they manufactured organic argan oil all by hand where we got to see the whole manufacturing process.
In the early afternoon we arrived at [Essaouira Lodge](https://www.essaouira-lodge.com/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} where we would be staying during the trip.
After checking in and unpacking our luggage, we set off to the Essaouira beach where we had delicious sea food at restaurant Fanatic.

With our hunger satisfied, we set off with our buses a bit further along the beach where we got to ride camels in caravans.
With our trusty newly allocated steeds we rode around the coast with the sun setting off in the background.
After about a 30-minute ride in the sand we arrived at a big tent where we would spend the rest of the evening.
As dinner was being prepared in many tajines, we were entertained by live Moroccan music and dancers with a big cozy bonfire blazing about.
What an amazing and memorable day this was.

The day after we went back to Essaouira beach and visited the fortress city with the walls still intact.
As we strolled through the alley streets we got to visit all kinds of shops and markets.
We had lunch on a roof terrace at [Il Mare](http://www.ilmaressaouira.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} with an amazing view on the sea.
Some more exploring was done around the city before returning to our lodges.
We spent the rest of the evening in our lodges where we invited all speakers in our lodge for a nice last evening together with a couple of Casablanca beers before returning the day after.

As we would not have been able to catch our flight back to Belgium in time, the four of us booked a [beautiful riad](https://www.airbnb.nl/rooms/11040206){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} right in the center of Marrakesh.
We explored the Djemaa el Fna together with its back alleys and visited an authentic tannery.

## Summing it all up
Devoxx MA was amazing experience for us where we got to meet and befriend a lot of great people.
We would like to thank the organisers for organising both Devoxx MA and offering us the chance to see more of Morocco with the speakers trip!
The date for next year's edition has already been announced and will happen on the 12th until the 14th of November 2019 so be sure to mark it in your agenda.
