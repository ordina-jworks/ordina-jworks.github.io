## [MongoDB Shootout: MongoDB Atlas, Azure CosmosDB and Doing It Yourself](https://www.percona.com/live/e17/sessions/mongodb-shootout-mongodb-atlas-azure-cosmosdb-and-doing-it-yourself){:target="_blank"}

When running MongoDB in the cloud, you have several options. Here David Murphy compared [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), [CosmosDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) and good old DIY.

Using Atlas, you get monitoring, automation and the possibility to pay for backups.
You pay per instance and you have a wide variety of instances and regions to choose from on AWS, GCP and Azure.
Biggest downside is that the cost is about 44% more than running you own servers in the cloud.
This means that, in contrast to DIY, you continuously pay more instead of writing of your initial investment and paying less in the end.
The monitoring is really good but the problem here is that if you have have a polyglot environment with your own monitoring and alerting, you can not integrate it with Atlas so you end up with yet another tool.
Upgrading is really easy and just a click of the button thanks to the automation.
Backups need to be payed for per GB and are taken continuously.

CosmosDB is offered by Microsoft on Azure and claims to be MongoDB compatible. 
This is not completely true because they have no support for the aggregation framework.
So you can only use it for simple CRUD operations.
The pricing is based on a pay-per-operation model which means it's really hard to figure out what your cost will be and how it will evolve over time.
Here you also have the downside of continuous paying more than DIY.
The monitoring is very basic and of no help when you run into problems or strange behaviour, it's like a black box.
Upgrading is done behind the scenes which means you don't have to worry unless the upgrade means your code is no longer compatible, then you are stuck.
Backups are very basic because they are taken approximately every four hours and only the latest 2 backups are stored.

DIY has the most power to offer IF you have a mature, and fully DevOps team.
With DIY you pay a high price up-front for hardware and people.
You need to implement your own monitoring, i.e. with the [Elastic stack](https://www.elastic.co/products) or Percona's [PMM](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html).
Also automation is a big part of the effort.
And last but not least, you need to implement your own backup strategy.
The biggest upside is you have full control over what you implement and how you do things.
You choose what cloud or hardware.
You choose what you want to monitor and how you alert.
You choose how often and when you backup.
But of course, it's all up to you.


## [Visualize Your Data With Grafana](https://www.percona.com/live/e17/sessions/visualize-your-data-with-grafana){:target="_blank"}

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is used to build monitoring dashboards based on time series data.
Grafana supports a wide range of [data sources](https://grafana.com/plugins?type=datasource) to get it's data and generate the dashboard.
There are already a lot of pre-build [dashboards](https://grafana.com/dashboards) you can use and customize for your own needs.
You can build your own dashboards with [panels](https://grafana.com/plugins?type=panel).
Each panel is fed with data from a datasource based on a query.
Grafana has created a query editor with support for different data sources, like PromQL for Prometheus, to make it easier to build the queries you need.
The end result can look like this :

## [Database Reliability Engineering: What, Why and How?](https://www.percona.com/live/e17/sessions/database-reliability-engineering-what-why-and-how){:target="_blank"}

The DBA from the old days, hidden in a basement behind closets, performing magic on that mysterious thing called a database, is dead.
Enter the Database Reliability Engineer, a person who embraces the new paradigms in the IT-world.
He is an advocate of how data should be treated and used, he teaches his colleagues, he takes part in pair-programming, he is an active team member in cross-functional teams.
A DBRE's knowledge is not confined to a single system, he can support polyglot persistence.
He can support these systems on premise and in the cloud.
He automates as much as possible and uses tools of the trade including source control systems and helps creating infrastructure as code.
Doing this, he can come to the point that he can achieve to make it clear to his organisation that data is
