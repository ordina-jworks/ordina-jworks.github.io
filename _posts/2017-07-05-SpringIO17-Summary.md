> On the 18th and 19th of May, we had another great edition of Spring I/O, brought to us by organizer [Sergi Almar](https://twitter.com/sergialmar){:target="_blank"}.
In this blog post, we will go over some of our favourite sessions of the conference.

> **DISCLAIMER**: this is obviously a very opinionated list of talks. This does not mean that the other talks were of lower quality, it just means we were not able to attend or did not take extensive notes.

# Keynote: The Only Constant Is Change

### by [Andy Wilkinson](https://twitter.com/ankinson){:target="_blank"} and [StÃ©phane Nicoll](https://twitter.com/snicoll){:target="_blank"}

Obviously, the keynote presentation was filled with announcements, interesting tidbits and two great presenters.

The biggest topic revolved around how **Spring has always tried to enable developers to adapt their applications rapidly**.
This capacity of adapting to change increased dramatically when Spring Boot was released, which explains part of its success.

They also reported the release of [Spring Boot 2.0.0 M1](https://spring.io/blog/2017/05/16/spring-boot-2-0-0-m1-available-now).
This release was announced very shortly after [Spring Framework 5.0 went RC1](https://spring.io/blog/2017/05/08/spring-framework-5-0-goes-rc1) on the 8th of May.

# Bootiful Database-centric applications with JOOQ

### by [Michael Simons](https://twitter.com/rotnroll666){:target="_blank"}

<span class="image left small"><img class="p-image" alt="Michael Simons" src="/img/SpringIO2017/michael-simons.jpg"></span>

As a personal fan of `@rotnroll666`, I went to see his talk, fully expecting to be impressed by the level of quality and code.
As always, Michael delivered: he made me realize **there are still plenty of PL/SQL developers out there in the enterprise landscape, who hold on to their code like kids to their favorite stuffed animal before bedtime**.

Luckily for us, someone created a library called **JOOQ**:

> jOOQ generates Java code from your database and lets you build type safe SQL queries through its fluent API

<span class="image left small"><img alt="jOOQ" src="/img/SpringIO2017/jooq.png"></span>

There are many use cases where jOOQ can prove useful, but the example that Michael used described the enterprise environment at his current employer:
He was working for a **big utility company** in Germany, who developed applications on power and gas usage consisting of **lots of time-series data**.
Almost all of the data was stored in SQL databases with a **big layer of PL/SQL on top**.
They also developed some desktop GIS applications using **Oracle Spatial** to visualize the data.

So the question they asked themselves at a certain moment:

> Should we approach all of our data using plain PL/SQL? Should we use an ORM tool like Hibernate? Or can we use something in between?

Of course, as with any good question, the answer is:

> It depends. **There is no silver bullet**

There are many options in the Java space to approach this problem:

- Plain JDBC
- Using a `JDBCTemplate`
- JPA with JPQL and / or Criteria API

Michael's team solved most of their problems using Hibernate, and while that comes with several advantages, it doesn't mean you have to use it for everything.
One of the improvements they made was using **Hibernate combined with jOOQ**:

- Use Hibernate for the regular database queries and *day-to-day manipulations of your database*
- Use jOOQ for your complex queries and database migrations

To briefly summarize what jOOQ can do for you:

- jOOQ is **SQL-centric** which means jOOQ infers information from the actual database, not from the ORM model
- It exposes a **typesafe meta-model** generated from your SQL
- The Query Builder framework uses a **very legible DSL** (in a much more concise way than the `Criteria API`)
- It generates a Java-based schema (using Maven or Gradle)
- It can reverse-engineer an existing DB and generate SQL
- Spring provides **integration with Spring Boot** through the `spring-boot-starter-jooq` dependency

An ideal scenario to use jOOQ would be to:

- Run your **database migration** with Flyway or Liquibase first
- Run the **code generator** to generate the Java DSL context (this happens in the Maven `generate-sources` lifecycle phase)
- Use the DSL context to **write your typesafe queries**, for example:

{% highlight java %}

BookRecord book = create.selectFrom(BOOK).where(BOOK.ID.eq(1)).fetchOne();

{% endhighlight %}

For more information about jOOQ, you can check out their website [here](https://www.jooq.org/){:target="_blank"}.

> Question: What's the difference between the jOOQ Query API and using JPA Criteria API with the Hibernate ModelGen, which is also typesafe?

- It resembles the native SQL much better
- jOOQ provides **standardization** since it performs SQL transformations that work for **any SQL dialect**
- It should make it easier to migrate existing PL/SQL applications
- There is a much more extensive collection of SQL functions and possibilities
- jOOQ provides POJO mappers which are also generated from the code generator
- As much as you hate them, it supports calling **Stored Procedures**!

# Google Spanner

### by [Robert Kubis](https://twitter.com/hostirosti){:target="_blank"}

Google Spanner is a **globally distributed relational database service** that provides ACID transactions and SQL semantics, without giving up horizontal scaling and high availability.

When building cloud applications, you are no longer forced to choose between traditional databases that guarantee transactional consistency, or NoSQL databases that offer simple, horizontal scaling and data distribution.
Cloud Spanner offers both of these critical capabilities in a single, fully managed service.
With Spanner, your database can scale up and down as needed, and you only pay for the amount you use.

Spanner keeps application development simple by supporting standard tools and languages in a familiar relational database environment.
It supports distributed transactions, schemas and DDL statements, SQL queries and JDBC drivers and offers client libraries for the most popular languages, including Java, Go, Python and Node.js.

As a managed service, Cloud Spanner provides key benefits to DBAs:
- **Focus on your application logic** instead of spending valuable time managing hardware and software.
- Scale out your RDBMS solutions without complex sharding or clustering.
- Gain **horizontal scaling** without migration from relational to NoSQL databases
- Maintain **high availability** and protect against disaster without needing to engineer a complex replication and failover infrastructure.
- Gain **integrated security** with data-layer encryption, identity and access management and audit logging

# Keycloak

### by [SÃ©bastien Blanc](https://twitter.com/sebi2706){:target="_blank"}

<span class="image left small"><img class="p-image" alt="SÃ©bastien Blanc" src="/img/SpringIO2017/sebi.jpg"></span>

I must say, this was one of the funniest talks of the conference.
SÃ©bastien knows how to entertain the crowd and he kicked off with a great quote which, of course, I immediately stole and tweeted:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="margin-top: 2em" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Similar to a quite from <a href="https://twitter.com/sebi2706">@sebi2706</a> last week at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/springio17?src=hash">#springio17</a> : forget about companies, it&#39;s all about community and code! ðŸ™Œ</p>&mdash; Dieter Hubau (@dhubau) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhubau/status/867999793280413698">May 26, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

First of all, let's forget that Keycloak was created by Redhat and that it is written in Java EE.
The following aspects of Keycloak are more important:

- It's Open Source ([homepage](http://www.keycloak.org/){:target="_blank"})
- Redhat provides support through their commercial fork called **Redhat SSO** ([homepage](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on){:target="_blank"})
- Great **Spring Boot Integration** through the use of a starter ([documentation](https://keycloak.gitbooks.io/documentation/securing_apps/topics/oidc/java/spring-boot-adapter.html){:target="_blank"})
- Seamless **Spring Security Integration**
- Supports OAuth 2.0, SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect
- Integration with Active Directory, LDAP and even Kerberos (*start drooling enterprise users!*)

It's actually quite easy to setup Keycloak:

- Download the Keycloak standalone server [here](https://downloads.jboss.org/keycloak/3.2.0.Final/keycloak-3.2.0.Final.zip){:target="_blank"}
- Extract and run it
- Start the server and create an admin user
- Create a new realm
- Create a new application
- Add roles to your application
- Create a user to authenticate with
- Create a Spring Boot application at [https://start.spring.io](start.spring.io){:target="_blank"}) and include the Keycloak starter
- Add the Keycloak properties to your application.yml:
    - server URL
    - realm
    - resource name of your application
    - security constraints for your users
- Run!

There are many additional features for power users:

- Automatic registration of applications should be possible using a one-time token (coming soon?)
- Centralized User Management
- **CORS support** for Single Page Applications
- Social Login Integration
- Registration and Forgot Password functionality, all out-of-the-box, configurable at runtime
- UI Customization of all pages is possible through theming (*start drooling designers!*)

All in all, the setup and demo went very smooth and **I genuinely feel this product is about to become very popular**, partly because of the Spring Boot integration, but also because it just seems very solid and user-friendly.
There might be a dedicated blogpost coming soon about Keycloak, so stay tuned and check our blog regularly or subscribe to our [RSS feed](http://localhost:4000/feed.xml){:target="_blank"}!

# Spring Cloud Streams (Data Services)

### by [Michael Minella](https://twitter.com/michaelminella){:target="_blank"}

- Lots of Big Data frameworks out there (Hadoop, Spark, ...)
- They can handle BIG amounts of data very well
- They are too bulky/difficult/inappropriate for smaller volumes of data
- Learning curve too high
- Use case: data microservices:
  - developed and tested in isolation, also easier to test
  - independently scalable depending on data processing load
  - familiar development model, just like regular cloud-native Spring microservices
  - easier to govern for Ops
  - the need for data/app integration/composition arises
  - the need for orchestration and operational coverage arises (lots of plumbing required)
- Spring Cloud Stream
  - Streams are thin wrappers around Spring integration
  - Supported binder for integration between services: Kafka, RabbitMQ, ...
  - Source, Processor, Sink
- Spring Cloud Task
  - Tasks are finite microservices, built around Spring Batch
  - "Microservices that end"
  - contains Task repository which tracks run/start/end of the tasks
  - has Spring Batch integration (partition steps using workers)
  - has Spring Cloud Stream integration (eg. launch Tasks via Streams)
  - simple annotation `@EnableTask`
  - use cases: batch jobs, scheduled one-off processes, ETL processing, data science
- Spring Cloud Data Flow
  - New and Improved Spring XD
  - Data flow orchestrator
  - Use a shell or the UI which goes over REST endpoints
  - Has custom DSL
  - Everything is Spring Boot (Data Flow server, Shell, ...)
  - Data Flow server has datastore for task repository, batch repository, configuration, ...
  - Data Flow server does **not** do any of the actual work

# Spring Cloud Functions

### by Dr. Dave Syer

- Cloud abstraction layers:
  - Virtual Machines (IaaS)
  - Containers (CaaS)
  - Applications (PaaS)
  - Functions (FaaS)

- Goal: raising the value line, going up the abstraction layers

- There are still other problems to be solved: service discovery, datastore connections, messaging systems

- Functions: a way of expressing business logic without having these others issues, small unit of work, a single deployment unit

- Compared to Spring as an application framework: Spring allows us to write business logic

> The naming of "Serverless" is just ridiculous, of course you're gonna have servers, you just don't care about them

- Functions:
  - Event driven
  - Dynamic resource utilization
  - Billing per message (changes the way we design software, has implications on how we think about software)
  - Prototypes become production code really quickly (going from idea to product in days or weeks)
  - Focus on business logic

  > Visual Basic was a tool we gave to idiots, since it was easy to create a program quickly - doesn't mean it was a good thing - so we have to be careful!

- Get out of the business of infra and automation, aka "undifferentiated heavy lifting" does not deliver business value
- Functions make this possible
- Comparable: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Function, Azure Function, IBM Openwhisk, Fission, Kubeless, ...

- Spring Cloud Functions:
  - All advantages of serverless/functions, but with all the possibilities that Spring offers (DI, integration, autoconfig, build tools)
  - Easy for Spring devs to jump on the FaaS model
  - Easy for FaaS people without having knowledge of Spring
  - Run the same business logic as web endpoint, stream processor or a task
  - uniform programming model across providers and able to run standalone (not on a IAAS or PAAS).
  - Supports reactive programming model (Flux, Mono) as well

{% highlight java %}
@Bean
public Function<Flux<String>, Flux<String>> uppercase() {
  return flux -> flux.filter(this::isNotRude).map(String::toUpperCase);
}
{% endhighlight %}

# The future of event driven microservices with spring cloud stream

### by [Kenny Bastani](https://twitter.com/kennybastani){:target="_blank"}

## Evolution

### Monolith application

* Slows our velocity getting into production
* Not as easy to add new engineers to a project
* To large for any one person to fully comprehend

### Monolith organization

* Centralized authority for operations, database and change management slows progress
* Coordinated releases batch many changes together from different teams
* Operations drives the runtime environment of applications
* Operations take all operation responsibility including upgrades of virtual machines
* Deploy everything at once or nothing at all

### Move towards SOA

Independent services: 
Key problem => shared libraries

### Microservices

Small teams organized around business capabilities with responsibility of running
Use rest api to communicates
Developers can choose tools

### Is it a Monolith or Microservice?

If it takes longer than a day for an engineer to ramp up its probably a monolith

Antipattern to have frontend communicate directly to microservices
Instead use edge service 

## Splitting the monolith

-> Slice off (hard in practice) service migration

### Why we need event-driven microservices

Problems:
* No foreign key constraints between services
* Distributed transactions are brittle
* Distributed systems are hard

Without event-driven microservices

> You will drown in problems you didn't know existed!
    
### Event-driven microservices

Domain events as a first class citizen 

(based on eventuate from Chris..)

* Use domain events for audit trails
* Each domain events contains subject and imutable data
* Every domain event applies a state transition to aggregate
* Event handler generate commands, commands generate events
...
* Regenerate state of aggregate by processing events 

Terminal state -> eventual consistency (order failed or succeeded)

Build hypermedia api's that attach:

* Event logs 
* Commands 
* Commits

as a link to an aggregate

### Event Handlers

Subscribe to an event an apply state changes to an aggregate.

CQRS is used to create materialized views from streams of events

Command side
Update Status

Query side

Command service writes events into kafka event store
Event processor loads events from store and update data store (mysql) 
Query side reads from the data stores

Serverless event handlers

# New in Spring 5: Functional Web Framework

### by [Arjen Poutsma](https://twitter.com/poutsma){:target="_blank"}

In the keynote Andy Wilkinson and StÃ©phane Nicoll mentioned that the Spring framework and especially **Spring Boot is all about providing choices to developers**.
The framework provides us with tools to tackle problems in multiple ways. 
In the light of this, starting from Spring 5 there will be a new functional alternative to handle incoming web requests.

This new functional web library is an alternative to annotation driven approach that is broadly applied in current applications.

> Arjen Poutsma states that some people are not happy with magic that happens behind the scenes when you use annotations like `@RequestMapping` or the newer `@GetMapping`

This was one of the reasons that made Spring develop this new library.

In the next sections we show a quick introduction to what was shown at Spring IO about what this new framework has to offer.

#### Handler function example

The following UserHandler class is the replacement of the Controller class that we would have annotated in the regular web framework. 
In this new functional style the way we handle requests is a bit different.
We define functions that have a ServerRequest as parameter and we return a Mono with a ServerResponse.

The request contains all the information we need.
It contains the body of the request, pathvariables, request headers, ...
So no more injecting pathvariables and body objects, we have everything we need in this ServerRequest.

What we return is the ServerResponse in which we can easily put all the information we want to give back to the client.
And Spring provides us with an easy builder to create such a response as it already did with the ResponseEntity builder.

You can see that these new objects and builders provide us with an easy and declarative way to handle request and create responses, without the "magic" that we used previously with the annotations.

{% highlight java %}
public class UserHandler {

    public UserHandler(UserRepository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }
    
    public Mono<ServerResponse> getUser(ServerRequest request) {
        int userId = Integer.valueOf(request.pathVariable("id"));
        Mono<ServerResponse> notFound = ServerResponse.notFound().build();
        Mono<User> userMono = this.repository.getUser(personId);
        
        return userMono
                .flatMap(user -> ServerResponse.ok().contentType(APPLICATION_JSON).body(fromObject(user)))
                .switchIfEmpty(notFound);
    }
    
    public Mono<ServerResponse> createUser(ServerRequest request) {
        Mono<User> user = request.bodyToMono(User.class);
        return ServerResponse.ok().build(this.repository.saveUser(user));
    }
    
    public Mono<ServerResponse> listUsers(ServerRequest request) {
        Flux<User> people = this.repository.allUsers();
        return ServerResponse.ok().contentType(APPLICATION_JSON).body(users, User.class);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now we have defined how we want to handle request and how we translate it to a response.
What we need next is a way to say which requests will be handled by which handler function.

In the old way this was done by defining an annotation that defined some parameters to couple for example a path to a method.
The functional web framework does this by creating RouterFunctions.

This RouterFunction is a function that takes a `ServerRequest` and returns a `Mono<HandlerFunction>`. 
To choose which requests get handled by which HandlerFunction, Spring again provides us with some builder functions.

That way we can easily bind the handlers we just created with a path as shown in the next code example.

#### Router example

{% highlight java %}
public RouterFunction<ServerResponse> routingFunction() {
    PersonHandler handler = new PersonHandler(userRepository);
    
    return nest(path("/person"),
            nest(accept(APPLICATION_JSON),
                    route(GET("/{id}"), handler::getPerson)
                    .andRoute(method(HttpMethod.GET), handler::listPeople)
            ).andRoute(POST("/").and(contentType(APPLICATION_JSON)), handler::createPerson));
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Creating a Tomcat server

Now that we have declared which routes are handled by which functions we have to let our server know this.
In the next code example we show how to create a Tomcat server and how to bind the `RouterFunction` to our server.

{% highlight java %}
public void startTomcatServer() throws LifecycleException {
    RouterFunction<?> route = routingFunction();
    HttpHandler httpHandler = toHttpHandler(route);
    
    Tomcat tomcatServer = new Tomcat();
    tomcatServer.setHostname(HOST);
    tomcatServer.setPort(PORT);
    Context rootContext = tomcatServer.addContext("", System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"));
    ServletHttpHandlerAdapter servlet = new ServletHttpHandlerAdapter(httpHandler);
    Tomcat.addServlet(rootContext, "httpHandlerServlet", servlet);
    rootContext.addServletMapping("/", "httpHandlerServlet");
    tomcatServer.start();
}
{% endhighlight %}

And then in the main method we only have to start our Tomcat server and we're up and running:

{% highlight java %}
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Server server = new Server();
    server.startTomcatServer();
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Conclusion
The new functional web framework gives us a more declarative and functional way to create a server and handle web requests. 
In my opinion this code is a lot clearer because you have a direct link between routing and handling requests.

This code may also be easer to test than the annotation driven web request handling because we don't necessarily need to fire up our spring context to test the routing.
We can just create a unit test for our RouterFunction and verify our routes are correct. 

What I do still wonder about is how this integrates with Spring security.
How can we define which users can access which handler.
Do we still do this with annotations or will we get a new way to do this as well?

The Spring functional web framework is an interesting new development and we will be following it closely to see how we can use it in our new projects.

# Spring Auto REST Docs
### by [Florian Benz](https://twitter.com/flbenz){:target="_blank"}

Spring Auto REST Docs is an extension on Spring REST Docs (**our post on Spring REST Docs can be found [here](https://ordina-jworks.github.io/conference/2016/06/30/SpringIO16-Spring-Rest-Docs.html){:target="_blank"}**).
This extension helps you to write even less code by including your Javadoc into the Spring REST Docs. 

For a more detailed overview on what is possible and how to start using this extension, please visit the official documentation [here](https://scacap.github.io/spring-auto-restdocs/){:target="_blank"}.

Imagine you have the following method in your controller:

{% highlight java %}
@RequestMapping("users")
public Page<ItemResponse> searchItem(@RequestParam("page") Integer page, @RequestParam("per_page") Integer per_page) { ... }
{% endhighlight %}

With the following POJO:

{% highlight java %}
public class User {
    private String username;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    
    ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

And the test that generates Spring REST Docs:

{% highlight java %}
this.mockMvc.perform(get("/users?page=2&per_page=100")) 
	.andExpect(status().isOk())
	.andDo(document("users", 
    requestParameters( 
        parameterWithName("page").description("The page to retrieve"), 
        parameterWithName("per_page").description("Entries per page") 
    ),
    responseFields(
            fieldWithPath("username").description("The user's unique database identifier."),
            fieldWithPath("firstName").description("The user's first name."),
            fieldWithPath("lastName").description("The user's last name."),
    )));
{% endhighlight %}

When using Spring Auto REST Docs, this could be replaced by adding **Javadoc** to the method in the controller:

{% highlight java %}
/**
 * @param page The page to retrieve
 * @param per_page Entries per page
 */
@RequestMapping("users")
public Page<ItemResponse> searchItem(@RequestParam("page") Integer page, @RequestParam("per_page") Integer per_page) { ... }
{% endhighlight %}

And adding Javadoc to the POJO fields:

{% highlight java %}
public class User {
    /**
    * The user's unique database identifier.
    */
    @NotBlank
    private String username;
    
    /**
    * The user's first name.
    */
    @Size(max = 20)
    private String firstName;
    
    /**
    * The user's last name.
    */
    @Size(max = 50)
    private String lastName;
    
    ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

And then removing the `requestParameters` and `responseFields` from the test:

{% highlight java %}
this.mockMvc.perform(get("/users?page=2&per_page=100")) 
	.andExpect(status().isOk());
{% endhighlight %}

You notice that I added the annotations `@NotBlank` and `@Size` in the POJO, these annotations will also be reflected in the resulting documentation.
You could also create your own annotations.

Result:

Path | Type | Optional | Description
-----|-----|-----|-----
username|String|false|The user's unique database identifier.
firstName|String|true|The user's first name. Size must be between 0 and 20 inclusive.
lastName|String|true|The user's last name. Size must be between 0 and 50 inclusive.

Because the description of the POJO is now added on field level, it is guaranteed that this description will be the same everywhere this field is used, meaning less maintenance is needed.
