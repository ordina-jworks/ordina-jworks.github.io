        <h2 class="major">Backend Practice</h2>
        <p>
           Within our Backend practice we have two focus areas today:
            <ul>
            <li>We help our customers build customised solutions</li>
            <li>We help them modernise their applications.</li>

           Tailor-made solutions are realised according to today's technological standards. A major focus today is the development of APIs.
           In application modernisation, we guide the client in their approach to legacy applications: typically, we do an audit of the existing application and then come up with a modernisation proposal.
           In both cases, we want to unburden the customer by also providing maintenance and support.

           <li>We are a team of Java experts. Java has no secrets for us and we also know the Spring stack through and through.
           Our applications are developed according to the most modern standards (Cloud-native, API-First, â€¦).</li>
            <li>We strive to remain market leaders in the ever-changing technology market.
                It is a personal goal of each employee to stay ahead of the market.
                Workshops, coding sessions and webinars, organized internally or externally, make this possible.</li>
            <li>We actively participate in knowledge sharing and through our Practice Meetings, each consultant stays informed of what is going on in his or her Practice.</li>
            <li>We also attend international conferences such as Spring I/O in Barcelona or Devoxx in Antwerp.</li>
        </ul>
